# Broken E2E Tests - Archived 2025-11-19

These tests reference the old session-based architecture which has been removed.

## Why Archived
The application architecture changed from multiple game sessions to a single persistent game world.
All session-related endpoints (/sessions) were removed.

## Status
- Tests are NOT deleted (preserved for reference)
- Tests are broken and will not run
- Will be rewritten in future sessions to match new architecture

## Files
- Feature files with session steps
- Step definitions referencing sessions
- Test suite documentation

See SIMPLIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md for current architecture.
