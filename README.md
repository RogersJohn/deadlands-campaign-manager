## Detailed Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Create a PostgreSQL database:

```bash
createdb deadlands
```

Or using psql:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE deadlands;
CREATE USER deadlands WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE deadlands TO deadlands;
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Create a local configuration file:

```bash
cp src/main/resources/application-local.yml.example src/main/resources/application-local.yml
```

Edit `application-local.yml` with your database credentials and JWT secret.

Build and run the application:

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`
