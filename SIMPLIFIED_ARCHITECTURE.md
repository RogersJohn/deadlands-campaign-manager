# Simplified Game Architecture - Single Campaign Design

**Date**: 2025-11-16
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

---

## Problem with Previous Design

The previous architecture was **fundamentally wrong** for the use case:

### ❌ What Was Wrong:
- **Multi-tenancy platform** (like Roll20/Foundry VTT)
  - Multiple separate game sessions
  - Players "join" and "leave" sessions
  - Session lobby, session rooms, session players
  - Overcomplicated for a single group campaign

### ✅ What Was Actually Needed:
- **Single shared campaign**
  - ONE game world that everyone plays in
  - GM has special powers, players have limited abilities
  - No "joining" - just log in and you're in the game
  - Session notes for wiki (historical records of play sessions)

---

## New Simplified Architecture

### User Flow

**Before (Overcomplicated):**
```
Login → Dashboard → Session Lobby → Select Session → Join Session → Session Room → Arena
```

**After (Simple):**
```
Login → Dashboard → Click "Play Game" → Arena ✅
```

### Access Model

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **Game Master** | Full control of game world, can modify everything |
| **Player** | Can control their own character, limited view/abilities |

**No session joining/leaving** - you're either in the game or not.

### File Structure

**Frontend Routes:**
- `/login` - Login page
- `/dashboard` - Home page with "Play Game" button
- `/arena` - The game (battlefield/combat)
- `/wiki` - Campaign wiki (includes session notes)
- `/character/:id` - Character sheets

**Removed Routes:**
- ~~`/sessions`~~ - Session lobby (deleted)
- ~~`/session/:id`~~ - Session room (deleted)
- ~~`/session/:id/arena`~~ - Session-specific arena (deleted)

---

## What Changed

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **App.tsx** - Simplified Routing
**Removed:**
- `SessionLobby` component import
- `SessionRoom` component import
- `/sessions` route
- `/session/:sessionId` route
- `/session/:sessionId/arena` route

**Added:**
- `/arena` route (simple, no session ID)

#### 2. **Dashboard.tsx** - Added "Play Game" Button
- Big green "Play Game" button that goes directly to `/arena`
- Welcome message with user's name
- Character list below

**Before:** Just a list of characters
**After:** Quick actions panel + character list

#### 3. **Layout.tsx** - Updated Navigation
**Removed:**
- "Sessions" menu item

**Changed:**
- "Game" → "Game Arena" (points to `/arena`)

#### 4. **GameArena.tsx** - Removed Session Dependency
**Removed:**
- `sessionId` from URL params
- `isMultiplayer` logic
- WebSocket session connection
- All multiplayer token synchronization

**Kept:**
- Single-player game logic
- Character selection
- Combat engine
- All game mechanics

**Note:** WebSocket can be re-added later for GM/player real-time sync, but without the session concept.

---

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **GameSessionController.java** - Marked Deprecated
- Added `@Deprecated` annotation to entire controller
- Added deprecation notice in JavaDoc
- Endpoints still work for backward compatibility but will be removed

**Deprecation Notice:**
```java
/**
 * @deprecated This entire session management system is being phased out.
 * The application now uses a single shared game world instead of multiple sessions.
 * These endpoints are kept for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future version.
 */
```

#### 2. **Future Cleanup** (Not Done Yet)
- Remove `GameSession` entity
- Remove `SessionPlayer` entity
- Remove `GameSessionService`
- Remove all session-related repositories
- Remove session DTOs

**Why not done now?** Keeping for reference in case we need to migrate data or understand the old system.

---

## Session Notes Feature (Future)

Instead of "game sessions" as separate instances, we'll have **session notes** as historical records:

### Concept:
```
Session 1 - October 15, 2025
Title: "The Ghost Town Investigation"
Notes: The party arrived in Gomorra and met Sheriff Lacy...

Session 2 - October 22, 2025
Title: "Showdown at the Saloon"
Notes: Tensions escalated when the Deaders attacked...
```

### Implementation (To Do):
1. **Wiki Section** - "/wiki/sessions"
2. **Simple Table:**
   - `session_notes` table
   - Fields: `id`, `session_number`, `date`, `title`, `notes`, `created_by`
3. **UI:**
   - GM can add new session notes from wiki
   - Players can read session notes
   - Chronological list of all play sessions

### How It's Different:
| Old "Sessions" | New "Session Notes" |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Separate game instances | Historical journal entries |
| Players join/leave | Just text records |
| Active/inactive state | Just a date and description |
| Complex entities | Simple wiki content |

## Benefits of Simplified Design

### ✅ User Experience
- **Easier onboarding** - "Click Play Game" vs navigating session lobby
- **Less confusion** - No "join session" step
- **Faster access** - 2 clicks to game instead of 5

### ✅ Developer Experience
- **Less code** - Removed ~1500 lines of session management
- **Simpler architecture** - No session lifecycle to manage
- **Easier to understand** - One game world, not multiple instances

### ✅ Performance
- **Smaller bundle** - Frontend build: 3.07 MB → 2.36 MB (23% reduction!)
- **Fewer API calls** - No session join/leave requests
- **Less database load** - No SessionPlayer queries

### ✅ Maintainability
- **Fewer bugs** - Less code = fewer places for bugs
- **Clearer intent** - Code matches actual use case
- **Future-proof** - Can add real multiplayer later if needed

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Frontend
- [x] Build succeeds with no errors
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Bundle size reduced

### Manual Testing (To Do):
- [ ] Login as player
- [ ] See Dashboard with "Play Game" button
- [ ] Click "Play Game" → Goes to `/arena`
- [ ] Game loads without errors
- [ ] Can select character and play
- [ ] Navigation menu shows "Game Arena"
- [ ] Click "Game Arena" in menu → Goes to `/arena`

### Backend Testing (To Do):

- [ ] Can deploy to production

---

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Data:
- **Old sessions in database** - Can remain (won't break anything)
- **SessionPlayer records** - Can remain (unused but harmless)
- **Future cleanup** - Can delete session tables later if needed

### For Existing Deployments:
- **No database migration required**
- **No breaking changes** - Old endpoints still work
- **Frontend refresh required** - Users need to reload app

- [ ] All users connect to same game room
- [ ] Broadcast token movements, dice rolls, etc.
- [ ] No "joining" - auto-connect when accessing `/arena`

### Persistent Game State
- [ ] Save game state to database
- [ ] Load state when accessing `/arena`
- [ ] GM can save/load different scenarios

---

## Conclusion

The architecture is now **aligned with the actual use case**:
- Single campaign, not multiple sessions
- Simple user flow: Login → Play
- Session notes for history (future feature)

**The game is simpler, faster, and easier to use.** ✅

---

## For Developers

### Adding New Features
When adding new features, follow the **single campaign** model:
- **Don't** create new sessions or instances
- **Do** add to the shared game world
- **Don't** require players to "join" anything
- **Do** let them just access features directly

### The Rule:
> **If you find yourself adding "join", "leave", or "session selection" logic, you're probably overcomplicating it.**

Keep it simple. One game. Multiple players. That's it.
