## The Dangerous Drifter

Mexicali Bob is a man of few words and considerable violence. At around 25 years old, he's built a reputation across the Southwest as someone you don't cross—a fighter of exceptional skill whose origins remain deliberately mysterious.

He appeared in Kansas Territory seeking work with the railroad companies, offering skills in security, enforcement, and handling "difficult situations." His capabilities proved themselves immediately, and Cornelius Vanderbilt III hired him without extensive questions about his background—a courtesy Bob clearly appreciates.

## The Fighter

Bob's most notable characteristic is his fighting ability. He's a devastating hand-to-hand combatant whose style seems unusual to those familiar with typical frontier brawling:

**Exceptional Technique**: Bob fights with precision and efficiency that suggests formal training rather than simple street-fighting experience. His movements are controlled, economical, and brutally effective.

**Unusual Style**: Observers note that his fighting incorporates techniques not commonly seen in the American West—strikes and grappling moves that seem foreign, perhaps Mexican or even older in origin.

**Remarkable Durability**: Bob takes hits that should drop a man and keeps fighting. He's been seen getting up from blows that would incapacitate most people, leading some to joke that he's too mean to stay down.

**Disarming Skill**: He has an uncanny ability to take weapons away from opponents, turning their own arms against them with moves that seem almost rehearsed.

**Controlled Violence**: When Bob fights, it's purposeful. He can scale his response from intimidation to incapacitation to lethal force as the situation demands.

## The Mystery Man

Bob volunteers little about his past, and those who ask pointed questions receive terse responses or polite but firm silence:

**Origins**: "From Mexico" is about as specific as he gets. Which part? Which family? How did he learn to fight like that? These questions go unanswered.

**Education**: Bob occasionally demonstrates knowledge that seems at odds with his presentation as a simple laborer—references to literature, understanding of formal Spanish that suggests education, manners that occasionally slip through his rough exterior.

**Motivation**: Why did he come north? What is he running from? Why does he sometimes seem to be looking over his shoulder? Bob doesn't share.

**The Limp**: Bob occasionally favors one side, as if an old injury still bothers him, though it never seems to slow him down when action is required.

## Professional Capabilities

As security for the Vanderbilt Continental Express, Bob has proven invaluable:

**Camp Security**: He handles troublemakers, breaks up fights between workers, and maintains order in situations where normal authority breaks down.

**Scouting**: Bob can move quietly, observe without being seen, and gather information about potential threats to the railroad operation.

**Intimidation**: Often, Bob's mere presence is enough to prevent trouble. There's something about him that makes even dangerous men reconsider their plans.

**Crisis Response**: When things go wrong—attacks on supply wagons, confrontations with hostile locals, sabotage attempts—Bob is the man Cornelius sends to handle it.

**Discretion**: Bob knows when to act and when to report. He understands that some problems require violence and others require information.

## The Man Himself

Those who work alongside Bob describe him as:

**Stoic**: He speaks little and reveals less. Most conversations with Bob involve short sentences and meaningful silences.

**Dangerous**: Even when relaxed, Bob projects an aura of controlled violence. People instinctively give him space.

**Reliable**: When Bob commits to a task or gives his word, he follows through absolutely. His loyalty, once earned, is unshakeable.

**Private**: Bob maintains clear boundaries about his personal life and past. He's courteous about deflecting questions, but the deflection is absolute.

**Alert**: Bob seems constantly aware of his surroundings, noting people and situations with an attentiveness that suggests either professional paranoia or legitimate concern about threats.

**Occasionally Cultured**: Sometimes Bob reveals knowledge or manners that seem at odds with his rough presentation—a slip that he quickly corrects, as if catching himself in an error.

## Rumors and Speculation

With someone as private as Bob, speculation fills the gaps:

**Former Soldado**: Some think he was a soldier in the Mexican army, explaining his discipline and fighting skills.

**Fugitive**: The way Bob sometimes watches the southern horizon suggests he's running from something in Mexico—law, enemies, or obligations.

**Disgraced Caballero**: His occasional displays of education and refinement lead some to wonder if he came from a higher station than he now occupies.

**Bandido**: Perhaps he rode with one of the border gangs and left that life behind, bringing his combat skills but leaving the criminality.

**Lost Family**: The haunted quality in Bob's eyes sometimes suggests personal tragedy—family killed, home destroyed, life upended by forces beyond his control.

Bob neither confirms nor denies any of these theories, maintaining his privacy through silence and redirection.

## Current Situation

Bob serves the Vanderbilt Continental Express with quiet efficiency, handling problems as they arise and asking few questions about the bigger picture. He seems content with the anonymity that railroad work provides—among hundreds of workers in constant westward movement, he's just another hired hand, albeit an exceptionally dangerous one.

He lives simply, keeps to himself when not working, and shows little interest in the social aspects of camp life. His few possessions are well-maintained but sparse—the belongings of a man who travels light and expects to keep moving.

Those who know him respect his capabilities and his privacy, understanding that Bob's past is his own business and that pressing for details would be both rude and potentially dangerous.

For now, Bob does his job, keeps the peace, and remains an enigma to those around him—a dangerous man with unknown origins, fighting for a railroad pushing into an uncertain future.
