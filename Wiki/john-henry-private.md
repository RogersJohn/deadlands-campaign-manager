## The Death That Wasn't

John Henry Faraday died several months ago.

The artillery shell came without warning—a cannonball that tore through the side of his torso, shattering ribs, pulverizing organs, and leaving a wound that no medical skill could treat. He was a trained doctor; he knew immediately that the injury was fatal. There would be no miraculous recovery, no last-minute salvation. Just pain, blood loss, shock, and then the darkness.

His death was absolute. The body left behind bore wounds that made survival impossible. By every measure that matters, John Henry Faraday ceased to exist.

But something brought him back.

In the moment between death and whatever comes after, John Henry's soul was intercepted by a manitou—an evil spirit that saw opportunity in his dying flesh. The manitou possessed his corpse, animated it, and brought John Henry back to a mockery of life.

This is what it means to be Harrowed: dead but walking, animated by an entity that should not exist, trapped in constant struggle for control of a body that no longer truly belongs to either inhabitant.

## The Manitou Inside

John Henry is not alone in his own head. The manitou that possesses him is a constant presence—malevolent, hungry, and intelligent. It whispers suggestions, urges violence, and constantly seeks to take full control of the body they now share.

The struggle is invisible to observers but never-ending for John Henry:

**Constant Vigilance**: Every moment requires effort to maintain control. The manitou probes for weaknesses, waits for moments of exhaustion or emotional vulnerability, and tries to seize control whenever John Henry's guard drops.

**Dark Urges**: The manitou feeds on fear, violence, and death. It wants John Henry to kill, to terrify, to spread the horror that spawned it. Resisting these urges requires willpower that drains him constantly.

**Shared Senses**: Sometimes John Henry sees through the manitou's perception—a world of death and decay, where living things appear as flickering flames and the boundaries between life and death blur into nightmare.

**The Dominion Struggle**: In moments of extreme stress, the manitou can temporarily seize control, forcing John Henry to watch helplessly as the creature uses his body for its own purposes. These episodes terrify him more than anything else about his condition.

## The Harrowed Condition

Being Harrowed grants John Henry abilities that seem supernatural because they are:

**Doesn't Need to Breathe**: His body no longer requires oxygen. He can work in environments that would kill the living, survive drowning or suffocation.

**Doesn't Need to Eat or Drink**: Sustenance is optional. The manitou's animating force sustains the body regardless of conventional nutrition.

**Incredible Durability**: Injuries that would kill a living man are merely inconvenient. Bullets pass through him, bones break and reset themselves, wounds that should be fatal become temporary setbacks.

**Supernatural Healing**: Damage repairs itself at impossible speeds. What would take weeks to heal takes days. Fatal injuries become survivable given enough time.

**No Fatigue**: Physical exhaustion is a memory. The body can work indefinitely without rest, though John Henry maintains the pretense of normal human limitations to avoid suspicion.

**Hexslinging Powers**: The manitou's presence grants access to supernatural abilities that manifest as hexes—the powers of a Huckster, card-slinging hexslinger drawing on demonic energy to warp reality.

## The Cannonball Wound

The scarring on John Henry's torso tells the story of his death—a massive impact wound where the cannonball tore through the right side of his body. The manitou reanimated his corpse, and while the supernatural healing closed the wounds enough to be functional, the scarring remains.

When fully clothed, the injury is completely hidden. But without his shirt, the evidence is undeniable—a large, devastating impact zone that should have been instantly fatal. The scars don't hurt (the dead don't feel pain the same way), but they serve as a constant physical reminder of what he is.

The fact that he survived such an injury would be impossible to explain to anyone who saw the scars. No conventional medical treatment could have saved someone with that wound. Which is why John Henry is extremely careful about who sees him without his shirt.

## The Hexes: Huckster's Dark Art

John Henry's hexslinging abilities manifest as a Huckster—he doesn't cast traditional magic, but instead channels demonic power through cards and gambling symbolism. The manitou grants him hexes that allow him to manipulate reality through the metaphor of the card game:

**Heal**: The power that made him invaluable as a medic—he can accelerate healing in others at supernatural speeds. Wounds close, bones knit, infections vanish. Those he treats don't know they're being touched by death made manifest, healed by power drawn from the grave itself. This hex allows him to maintain his cover as an exceptional doctor while using abilities no living physician could possess.

**Boost**: A hex that grants supernatural enhancement—increased speed, additional actions, capabilities beyond normal human limits. When activated, John Henry can move faster, act quicker, and accomplish in seconds what should take minutes. He uses this sparingly, only in moments when normal speed would result in death or discovery. The manitou's power coursing through dead muscles, animating them beyond what living flesh could achieve.

**Spiritual Pathway**: Perhaps the most unsettling of his hexes—the ability to become insubstantial, like a ghost. When activated, he can phase through solid matter, become intangible to physical attacks, exist partially in the spirit world. It's a reminder that he's not truly alive anymore, that the boundary between life and death has become permeable for him. Using this power feels like temporarily surrendering to what he truly is—a spirit animating dead flesh.

**Other Hexslinging Powers**: The manitou has granted him access to additional hexes as his power grows: Helper Hex (extending supernatural aid to others), Feast (summoning food from nothing), Noxious Breath (poison breath), and others. Each hex represents another thread of the manitou's influence, another way the demon's power manifests through his undead body. These powers follow the Huckster tradition—reality-warping abilities channeled through gambling metaphors and card symbolism.

John Henry uses his hexes as sparingly as possible. Each activation strengthens the manitou's hold, each supernatural act pulls him further from humanity. But in moments of crisis, the temptation to use powers that could save lives—or save his own existence—becomes impossible to resist.

## The Card Sharp's Skills

In life, John Henry had no particular talent for gambling or card manipulation—he was a doctor, focused on medicine and healing. Since his resurrection, the manitou has granted him supernatural proficiency with cards and games of chance.

His gambling skills and card tricks aren't learned abilities—they're manifestations of his Huckster nature. When he shuffles a deck, cards fall where the manitou wants them. When he plays poker, supernatural influence guides the game. His sleight of hand techniques work because reality bends slightly to accommodate them.

Every time he demonstrates card tricks or wins at gambling, he's using power drawn from the demon inside him. It's another reminder that his capabilities are no longer his own—they belong to the thing that killed him and stole his body.

## The Gunfighter's Reflexes

Before death, John Henry possessed basic shooting skills—enough for frontier self-defense. Since resurrection, his combat capabilities have been enhanced by the Harrowed condition. The manitou's animating force grants reflexes no living human could match, reaction speeds that defy natural limits.

His gunfighting ability comes from undead reflexes and inhuman durability. He doesn't need to fear being shot because bullets can't kill what's already dead. He can take risks in combat that would be suicidal for a living gunfighter, knowing that wounds that would kill others will merely inconvenience him.

This makes him far more dangerous than his skill level alone would suggest—a competent shooter made nearly unstoppable by supernatural resilience.

## The Terrible Secret

What makes John Henry's condition truly horrifying is that he must hide it absolutely:

**If Others Knew**: Being Harrowed is considered an abomination by those who understand such things. The Church would demand his destruction. Superstitious folk would lynch him. Even those who accept the supernatural would view him as a threat requiring elimination.

**The Constant Deception**: Every interaction requires lies. He must pretend to breathe, must fake eating and drinking, must simulate fatigue and injury responses. One slip, one moment of carelessness, and everything collapses.

**The Moral Weight**: John Henry is animated by evil. The manitou inside him is not a neutral force—it is malevolent, destructive, and fundamentally wrong. Every day he maintains control is a victory, but also a reminder of what he's become.

**The Question of Humanity**: Is he still John Henry Faraday? Or is he a corpse being puppeteered by a demon wearing the memories of a dead man? The philosophical question haunts him more than the physical condition.

## Living the Lie

John Henry must maintain the appearance of being alive, which requires constant deception:

**Simulating Breath**: He doesn't need to breathe, but must remember to do so anyway to maintain the illusion.

**Faking Fatigue**: The body never tires, but showing superhuman endurance would raise questions.

**Hiding the Scars**: The cannonball wound is absolutely concealed beneath clothing. Only in medical emergencies, when treating patients in situations requiring physical assistance, does anyone risk glimpsing the devastating scarring—and even then, he ensures witnesses are minimal and explanations are deflected.

**Maintaining Temperature**: Dead flesh doesn't maintain normal body temperature. John Henry must be careful about prolonged physical contact that might reveal his unnatural coldness.

**Pretending to Eat**: The body requires no sustenance, but he must occasionally consume food and drink to maintain the pretense of life.

## The Constant Struggle

Every moment of John Henry's existence requires conscious effort:

**Maintaining Control**: Constant vigilance against the manitou's attempts to seize dominance. One moment of weakness, and the demon takes over.

**Preserving Humanity**: Deliberate effort to maintain human emotions, human concerns, human morality against the cold logic of undeath.

**Protecting Others**: Using his abilities to help people while knowing that he's fundamentally wrong, that his very existence violates natural law.

**Finding Purpose**: Searching for meaning in a life that already ended, trying to accomplish something worthy before the manitou's influence finally corrupts him beyond redemption.

## The Railroad Work

John Henry's position with the Vanderbilt Continental Express serves multiple purposes:

**Usefulness**: His medical abilities (enhanced by hexslinging) make him invaluable, ensuring his position remains secure even as questions about his methods accumulate.

**Movement**: The railroad's westward progress keeps him ahead of anyone who might be searching, anyone who witnessed his death, anyone who knows what he is.

**Purpose**: Helping the railroad succeed, protecting workers, healing the injured—these give meaning to an existence that should not be.

**Anonymity**: Among hundreds of workers in constant motion westward, he can maintain distance from anyone who might see too clearly.

## The Future He Dreads

John Henry knows his current situation cannot last indefinitely:

**The Manitou Grows Stronger**: With each use of his powers, the demon's influence increases. Eventually, it will be strong enough to seize permanent control, and John Henry will become a passenger in his own body—if he retains any consciousness at all.

**Discovery**: Someone will eventually see something they shouldn't, notice something that doesn't add up, witness the truth about what he is. When that happens, everything collapses.

**Moral Corruption**: The constant exposure to the manitou's influence, the regular use of powers that violate natural law, the daily deceptions—all of it erodes his humanity. He fears not the body's destruction but the soul's corruption.

**The Final Choice**: Eventually, John Henry may face a choice: allow the manitou to take permanent control, or find some way to end his own existence permanently. Neither option appeals, but doing nothing may not remain possible.

## The Truth He Cannot Speak

John Henry Faraday walks among the living, but he is not one of them. He helps people, but with powers drawn from evil. He maintains humanity's appearance while being fundamentally inhuman. He exists in constant fear of discovery, constant struggle against internal evil, and constant doubt about whether his continued existence serves any purpose beyond the manitou's dark agenda.

The public sees a talented doctor and dangerous gunfighter with unusual luck at cards. His colleagues see a valuable medical professional with a troubled past. His friends (if he dares call them that) see a competent practitioner with mysterious abilities.

None of them see the truth: a dead man walking, animated by evil, struggling to do good with powers drawn from darkness, fighting a losing battle against the demon that shares his flesh.

This is what it means to be Harrowed. This is the secret that John Henry Faraday must carry alone until the day his struggle finally ends—one way or another.
