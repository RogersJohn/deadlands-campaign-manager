## The Death That Wasn't

John Henry Faraday died several months ago.

The specifics of his death remain traumatic to recall—violence, betrayal, pain, and then darkness. His body was broken, his blood spilled, his life ended. By every measure that matters, John Henry ceased to exist.

But something brought him back.

In the moment between death and whatever comes after, John Henry's soul was intercepted by a manitou—an evil spirit that saw opportunity in his dying flesh. The manitou possessed his corpse, animated it, and brought John Henry back to a mockery of life.

This is what it means to be Harrowed: dead but walking, animated by an entity that should not exist, trapped in constant struggle for control of a body that no longer truly belongs to either inhabitant.

## The Manitou Inside

John Henry is not alone in his own head. The manitou that possesses him is a constant presence—malevolent, hungry, and intelligent. It whispers suggestions, urges violence, and constantly seeks to take full control of the body they now share.

The struggle is invisible to observers but never-ending for John Henry:

**Constant Vigilance**: Every moment requires effort to maintain control. The manitou probes for weaknesses, waits for moments of exhaustion or emotional vulnerability, and tries to seize control whenever John Henry's guard drops.

**Dark Urges**: The manitou feeds on fear, violence, and death. It wants John Henry to kill, to terrify, to spread the horror that spawned it. Resisting these urges requires willpower that drains him constantly.

**Shared Senses**: Sometimes John Henry sees through the manitou's perception—a world of death and decay, where living things appear as flickering flames and the boundaries between life and death blur into nightmare.

**The Dominion Struggle**: In moments of extreme stress, the manitou can temporarily seize control, forcing John Henry to watch helplessly as the creature uses his body for its own purposes. These episodes terrify him more than anything else about his condition.

## The Harrowed Condition

Being Harrowed grants John Henry abilities that seem supernatural because they are:

**Doesn't Need to Breathe**: His body no longer requires oxygen. He can work in environments that would kill the living, survive drowning or suffocation.

**Doesn't Need to Eat or Drink**: Sustenance is optional. The manitou's animating force sustains the body regardless of conventional nutrition.

**Incredible Durability**: Injuries that would kill a living man are merely inconvenient. Bullets pass through him, bones break and reset themselves, wounds that should be fatal become temporary setbacks. The "recent injuries" others notice are actually the visible evidence of his death and resurrection—marks that won't fully heal because the body isn't truly alive.

**Supernatural Healing**: Damage repairs itself at impossible speeds. What would take weeks to heal takes days. Fatal injuries become survivable given enough time.

**No Fatigue**: Physical exhaustion is a memory. The body can work indefinitely without rest, though John Henry maintains the pretense of normal human limitations to avoid suspicion.

**Hexslinging Powers**: The manitou's presence grants access to supernatural abilities that manifest as hexes. John Henry has discovered several, each more disturbing in its implications than the last.

## The Hexes

John Henry's hexslinging abilities, powered by the manitou within, include:

**Deflect**: Reality itself seems to bend around him, turning aside bullets and blows that should connect. The manitou protects its host, not from compassion but from self-interest—if John Henry dies permanently, so does the manitou.

**Ghost Rider**: He can move with supernatural stealth, seeming to fade from perception even when in plain sight. Observers' eyes slide past him as if he were already a ghost.

**Helpin' Hand**: John Henry can extend supernatural influence to aid others, granting them temporary abilities beyond their normal capabilities. The manitou's power flowing through him into others, a violation of natural law that feels wrong even as it proves useful.

**Mend**: The most disturbing of his hexes—he can accelerate healing in others as his own body heals itself, forcing living flesh to repair at impossible speeds. Those he heals don't know they're being touched by death made manifest.

**Missed Me**: Attacks aimed at John Henry sometimes simply fail, as if reality itself rejects his permanent destruction. The manitou's supernatural influence bending probability.

**Forget**: Perhaps the most useful and most horrifying—John Henry can make people forget what they've witnessed, erasing memories that would reveal his true nature.

## The Mad Science

Before his death, John Henry possessed unusual talent with mechanical and medical innovation. Since his resurrection, these abilities have become something else entirely—Mad Science in the truest sense.

His inventions work through principles that conventional science cannot explain:

**Impossible Materials**: Devices constructed from substances that shouldn't exist, alloys that defy metallurgy, organic components incorporated into mechanical systems.

**Violation of Physical Law**: Machines that produce more energy than they consume, medical instruments that diagnose through means that physics doesn't accommodate, weapons that improve themselves over time.

**Intuitive Understanding**: John Henry knows how to build things he's never studied, understands principles he's never been taught. The manitou's supernatural nature grants insights that living scientists cannot access.

The line between genius innovation and unholy creation blurs in his workshop. Every device he builds carries a touch of the supernatural, though he frames them in conventional terms to avoid uncomfortable questions.

## The Terrible Secret

What makes John Henry's condition truly horrifying is that he must hide it absolutely:

**If Others Knew**: Being Harrowed is considered an abomination by those who understand such things. The Church would demand his destruction. Superstitious folk would lynch him. Even those who accept the supernatural would view him as a threat requiring elimination.

**The Constant Deception**: Every interaction requires lies. He must pretend to breathe, must fake eating and drinking, must simulate fatigue and injury responses. One slip, one moment of carelessness, and everything collapses.

**The Moral Weight**: John Henry is animated by evil. The manitou inside him is not a neutral force—it is malevolent, destructive, and fundamentally wrong. Every day he maintains control is a victory, but also a reminder of what he's become.

**The Question of Humanity**: Is he still John Henry Faraday? Or is he a corpse being puppeteered by a demon wearing the memories of a dead man? The philosophical question haunts him more than the physical condition.

## The Recent "Injury"

The scars and wounds that others notice are not from any recent injury—they're the visible evidence of his death and resurrection. The manitou reanimated a corpse, and while it can make the body functional, it cannot make it perfectly alive.

The marks of whatever killed him remain visible, a constant reminder of what he is. He moves carefully not from pain but from the need to maintain the illusion of living flesh that might hurt. He grimaces not from discomfort but from the horror of his own condition.

## The Constant Struggle

Every moment of John Henry's existence requires conscious effort:

**Maintaining Control**: Constant vigilance against the manitou's attempts to seize dominance. One moment of weakness, and the demon takes over.

**Preserving Humanity**: Deliberate effort to maintain human emotions, human concerns, human morality against the cold logic of undeath.

**Protecting Others**: Using his abilities to help people while knowing that he's fundamentally wrong, that his very existence violates natural law.

**Finding Purpose**: Searching for meaning in a life that already ended, trying to accomplish something worthy before the manitou's influence finally corrupts him beyond redemption.

## The Railroad Work

John Henry's position with the Vanderbilt Continental Express serves multiple purposes:

**Anonymity**: Among hundreds of workers in constant motion westward, he can maintain distance from anyone who might see too clearly.

**Usefulness**: His abilities make him invaluable, ensuring his position remains secure even as questions about his methods accumulate.

**Movement**: The railroad's westward progress keeps him ahead of anyone who might be searching, anyone who witnessed his death, anyone who knows what he is.

**Purpose**: Helping the railroad succeed, protecting workers, healing the injured—these give meaning to an existence that should not be.

## The Future He Dreads

John Henry knows his current situation cannot last indefinitely:

**The Manitou Grows Stronger**: With each use of his powers, the demon's influence increases. Eventually, it will be strong enough to seize permanent control, and John Henry will become a passenger in his own body—if he retains any consciousness at all.

**Discovery**: Someone will eventually see something they shouldn't, notice something that doesn't add up, witness the truth about what he is. When that happens, everything collapses.

**Moral Corruption**: The constant exposure to the manitou's influence, the regular use of powers that violate natural law, the daily deceptions—all of it erodes his humanity. He fears not the body's destruction but the soul's corruption.

**The Final Choice**: Eventually, John Henry may face a choice: allow the manitou to take permanent control, or find some way to end his own existence permanently. Neither option appeals, but doing nothing may not remain possible.

## The Truth He Cannot Speak

John Henry Faraday walks among the living, but he is not one of them. He helps people, but with powers drawn from evil. He maintains humanity's appearance while being fundamentally inhuman. He exists in constant fear of discovery, constant struggle against internal evil, and constant doubt about whether his continued existence serves any purpose beyond the manitou's dark agenda.

The public sees a talented gunsmith and healer with unusual methods. His colleagues see a valuable but mysterious technical specialist. His friends (if he dares call them that) see a competent professional with a troubled past.

None of them see the truth: a dead man walking, animated by evil, struggling to do good with powers drawn from darkness, fighting a losing battle against the demon that shares his flesh.

This is what it means to be Harrowed. This is the secret that John Henry Faraday must carry alone until the day his struggle finally ends—one way or another.
