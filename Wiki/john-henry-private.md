## The Death That Wasn't

John Henry Faraday died several months ago.

The artillery shell came without warning—a cannonball that tore through the side of his torso, shattering ribs, pulverizing organs, and leaving a wound that no medical skill could treat. He was a trained doctor; he knew immediately that the injury was fatal. There would be no miraculous recovery, no last-minute salvation. Just pain, blood loss, shock, and then the darkness.

His death was absolute. The body left behind bore wounds that made survival impossible. By every measure that matters, John Henry Faraday ceased to exist.

But something brought him back.

In the moment between death and whatever comes after, John Henry's soul was intercepted by a manitou—an evil spirit that saw opportunity in his dying flesh. The manitou possessed his corpse, animated it, and brought John Henry back to a mockery of life.

This is what it means to be Harrowed: dead but walking, animated by an entity that should not exist, trapped in constant struggle for control of a body that no longer truly belongs to either inhabitant.

## The Manitou Inside

John Henry is not alone in his own head. The manitou that possesses him is a constant presence—malevolent, hungry, and intelligent. It whispers suggestions, urges violence, and constantly seeks to take full control of the body they now share.

The struggle is invisible to observers but never-ending for John Henry:

**Constant Vigilance**: Every moment requires effort to maintain control. The manitou probes for weaknesses, waits for moments of exhaustion or emotional vulnerability, and tries to seize control whenever John Henry's guard drops.

**Dark Urges**: The manitou feeds on fear, violence, and death. It wants John Henry to kill, to terrify, to spread the horror that spawned it. Resisting these urges requires willpower that drains him constantly.

**Shared Senses**: Sometimes John Henry sees through the manitou's perception—a world of death and decay, where living things appear as flickering flames and the boundaries between life and death blur into nightmare.

**The Dominion Struggle**: In moments of extreme stress, the manitou can temporarily seize control, forcing John Henry to watch helplessly as the creature uses his body for its own purposes. These episodes terrify him more than anything else about his condition.

## The Harrowed Condition

Being Harrowed grants John Henry abilities that seem supernatural because they are:

**Doesn't Need to Breathe**: His body no longer requires oxygen. He can work in environments that would kill the living, survive drowning or suffocation.

**Doesn't Need to Eat or Drink**: Sustenance is optional. The manitou's animating force sustains the body regardless of conventional nutrition.

**Incredible Durability**: Injuries that would kill a living man are merely inconvenient. Bullets pass through him, bones break and reset themselves, wounds that should be fatal become temporary setbacks.

**Supernatural Healing**: Damage repairs itself at impossible speeds. What would take weeks to heal takes days. Fatal injuries become survivable given enough time.

**No Fatigue**: Physical exhaustion is a memory. The body can work indefinitely without rest, though John Henry maintains the pretense of normal human limitations to avoid suspicion.

**Hexslinging Powers**: The manitou's presence grants access to supernatural abilities that manifest as hexes. John Henry has discovered several, each more disturbing in its implications than the last.

## The Cannonball Wound

The scarring on John Henry's torso tells the story of his death—a massive impact wound where the cannonball tore through the right side of his body. The manitou reanimated his corpse, and while the supernatural healing closed the wounds enough to be functional, the scarring remains.

When fully clothed, the injury is completely hidden. But without his shirt, the evidence is undeniable—a large, devastating impact zone that should have been instantly fatal. The scars don't hurt (the dead don't feel pain the same way), but they serve as a constant physical reminder of what he is.

The fact that he survived such an injury would be impossible to explain to anyone who saw the scars. No conventional medical treatment could have saved someone with that wound. Which is why John Henry is extremely careful about who sees him without his shirt.

## The Hexes

John Henry's hexslinging abilities, powered by the manitou within, have evolved since his resurrection. The powers he currently possesses include:

**Heal**: The power that made him invaluable as a medic—he can accelerate healing in others at supernatural speeds. Wounds close, bones knit, infections vanish. Those he treats don't know they're being touched by death made manifest, healed by power drawn from the grave itself. This was one of his earliest and most-used hexes, allowing him to maintain his cover as an exceptional doctor.

**Boost**: A hex that grants supernatural speed and additional actions. When activated, John Henry can move faster, act quicker, and accomplish in seconds what should take minutes. He uses this sparingly, only in moments when normal speed would result in death or discovery. The manitou's power coursing through dead muscles, animating them beyond what living flesh could achieve.

**Spiritual Pathway**: Perhaps the most unsettling of his hexes—the ability to become insubstantial, like a ghost. When activated, he can phase through solid matter, become intangible to physical attacks, exist partially in the spirit world. It's a reminder that he's not truly alive anymore, that the boundary between life and death has become permeable for him. Using this power feels like temporarily surrendering to what he truly is—a spirit animating dead flesh.

**Other Hexes**: The manitou has granted him access to additional powers: Helper Hex (extending supernatural aid to others), Boost (enhancing abilities), Noxious Breath (poison breath), and others. Each hex represents another thread of the manitou's influence, another way the demon's power manifests through his dead body.

John Henry uses his hexes as sparingly as possible. Each activation strengthens the manitou's hold, each supernatural act pulls him further from humanity. But in moments of crisis, the temptation to use powers that could save lives—or save his own existence—becomes impossible to resist.

## The Supernatural Tinkering

In life, John Henry was a doctor—his expertise was medicine, anatomy, and the treatment of illness and injury. He had no particular mechanical aptitude beyond what any educated person might possess.

Since his resurrection, the manitou has granted him supernatural understanding of mechanisms, devices, and equipment. This is not skill acquired through study or practice—it's knowledge that simply exists in his mind, placed there by the demon that animates his corpse.

His "tinkering" works through principles that conventional science cannot explain:

**Impossible Understanding**: John Henry knows how to repair and modify firearms despite never training as a gunsmith. He understands mechanical principles he never studied. The manitou grants insights that living craftsmen must acquire through years of apprenticeship.

**Supernatural Enhancement**: Devices he modifies work better than they should. Weapons become more accurate, mechanisms more reliable, equipment more durable. These improvements defy conventional engineering because they're not conventional—they're touched by the manitou's power.

**Intuitive Innovation**: Given tools and materials, John Henry can solve technical problems that stump trained engineers. Not through superior expertise, but through supernatural intuition that simply knows the answers.

This sudden mechanical expertise is deeply disturbing to John Henry. Every time he repairs a weapon or solves an engineering problem, he's using knowledge that came from the demon inside him. It's a constant reminder that his capabilities are no longer his own—they belong to the thing that killed him and stole his body.

The line between skilled craftsmanship and unholy creation blurs in his workshop. Every device he builds or repairs carries a touch of the supernatural, though he carefully frames his work in conventional terms to avoid uncomfortable questions about where a medical doctor learned gunsmithing.

## The Terrible Secret

What makes John Henry's condition truly horrifying is that he must hide it absolutely:

**If Others Knew**: Being Harrowed is considered an abomination by those who understand such things. The Church would demand his destruction. Superstitious folk would lynch him. Even those who accept the supernatural would view him as a threat requiring elimination.

**The Constant Deception**: Every interaction requires lies. He must pretend to breathe, must fake eating and drinking, must simulate fatigue and injury responses. One slip, one moment of carelessness, and everything collapses.

**The Moral Weight**: John Henry is animated by evil. The manitou inside him is not a neutral force—it is malevolent, destructive, and fundamentally wrong. Every day he maintains control is a victory, but also a reminder of what he's become.

**The Question of Humanity**: Is he still John Henry Faraday? Or is he a corpse being puppeteered by a demon wearing the memories of a dead man? The philosophical question haunts him more than the physical condition.

## Living the Lie

John Henry must maintain the appearance of being alive, which requires constant deception:

**Simulating Breath**: He doesn't need to breathe, but must remember to do so anyway to maintain the illusion.

**Faking Fatigue**: The body never tires, but showing superhuman endurance would raise questions.

**Hiding the Scars**: The cannonball wound is absolutely concealed beneath clothing. Only in medical emergencies, when treating patients in situations requiring physical assistance, does anyone risk glimpsing the devastating scarring—and even then, he ensures witnesses are minimal and explanations are deflected.

**Maintaining Temperature**: Dead flesh doesn't maintain normal body temperature. John Henry must be careful about prolonged physical contact that might reveal his unnatural coldness.

## The Constant Struggle

Every moment of John Henry's existence requires conscious effort:

**Maintaining Control**: Constant vigilance against the manitou's attempts to seize dominance. One moment of weakness, and the demon takes over.

**Preserving Humanity**: Deliberate effort to maintain human emotions, human concerns, human morality against the cold logic of undeath.

**Protecting Others**: Using his abilities to help people while knowing that he's fundamentally wrong, that his very existence violates natural law.

**Finding Purpose**: Searching for meaning in a life that already ended, trying to accomplish something worthy before the manitou's influence finally corrupts him beyond redemption.

## The Railroad Work

John Henry's position with the Vanderbilt Continental Express serves multiple purposes:

**Anonymity**: Among hundreds of workers in constant motion westward, he can maintain distance from anyone who might see too clearly.

**Usefulness**: His abilities make him invaluable, ensuring his position remains secure even as questions about his methods accumulate.

**Movement**: The railroad's westward progress keeps him ahead of anyone who might be searching, anyone who witnessed his death, anyone who knows what he is.

**Purpose**: Helping the railroad succeed, protecting workers, healing the injured—these give meaning to an existence that should not be.

## The Future He Dreads

John Henry knows his current situation cannot last indefinitely:

**The Manitou Grows Stronger**: With each use of his powers, the demon's influence increases. Eventually, it will be strong enough to seize permanent control, and John Henry will become a passenger in his own body—if he retains any consciousness at all.

**Discovery**: Someone will eventually see something they shouldn't, notice something that doesn't add up, witness the truth about what he is. When that happens, everything collapses.

**Moral Corruption**: The constant exposure to the manitou's influence, the regular use of powers that violate natural law, the daily deceptions—all of it erodes his humanity. He fears not the body's destruction but the soul's corruption.

**The Final Choice**: Eventually, John Henry may face a choice: allow the manitou to take permanent control, or find some way to end his own existence permanently. Neither option appeals, but doing nothing may not remain possible.

## The Truth He Cannot Speak

John Henry Faraday walks among the living, but he is not one of them. He helps people, but with powers drawn from evil. He maintains humanity's appearance while being fundamentally inhuman. He exists in constant fear of discovery, constant struggle against internal evil, and constant doubt about whether his continued existence serves any purpose beyond the manitou's dark agenda.

The public sees a talented gunsmith and healer with unusual methods. His colleagues see a valuable but mysterious technical specialist. His friends (if he dares call them that) see a competent professional with a troubled past.

None of them see the truth: a dead man walking, animated by evil, struggling to do good with powers drawn from darkness, fighting a losing battle against the demon that shares his flesh.

This is what it means to be Harrowed. This is the secret that John Henry Faraday must carry alone until the day his struggle finally ends—one way or another.
