## The Noble He Never Wanted to Be

The man known as "Mexicali Bob" is not who he claims to be. His true name connects him to Mexican nobility with direct lineage to the Aztec Empire—a bloodline that has maintained its power and influence through Spanish colonial rule and into Mexican independence.

His family possesses something more valuable than mere land and gold: they carry the blood of ancient priest-kings, a lineage that connects them to powers and entities that predate Christianity by centuries.

### The Family Secret

In the secret chambers of his family's hacienda, ceremonies are conducted that would horrify the Catholic Church and terrify rational men. His family believes—knows, they would insist—that the old gods of Mesoamerica never truly died. They merely slept, waiting for the proper bloodlines and the proper rituals to call them back.

Bob's blood is among the purest remaining, marked by signs that his family's brujos recognized at his birth:
- Physical characteristics that match ancient codices
- Birthmarks that correspond to sacred symbols
- A quality in his blood that responds to ritual in ways that lesser bloodlines do not

He was not raised as a person but as a sacred instrument, a living sacrifice-in-waiting whose entire life was preparation for a single cosmic purpose.

### The Destined Sacrifice

Bob's family intends to perform an ancient ceremony—a ritual sacrifice that would:
- Restore their connection to the old gods
- Grant them supernatural power and influence
- Cement their position as intermediaries between the mortal world and divine forces
- Fulfill obligations made by their ancestors centuries ago

The ceremony requires a willing participant of pure bloodline, or at least someone who has been properly conditioned through years of ritual preparation. Bob represents decades of investment—prayers, ceremonies, education in the old ways, and careful preservation of bloodline purity.

His death would not be murder in his family's eyes—it would be apotheosis, transformation, sacred duty fulfilled.

### The Escape

As Bob matured and understood what his family intended, the horror of his destiny became impossible to ignore. He was not a person to them—he was currency, a bargaining chip to purchase cosmic favor, a tool to be used and discarded in service of powers that terrified him.

So he ran.

The escape required careful planning:
- Faking compliance while preparing resources
- Identifying the moment when security would be lax
- Severing all connections to his noble identity
- Disappearing into the frontier where family influence couldn't easily reach

He became "Bob," just another Mexican laborer making his way in a rough world. His noble bearing, his education, his combat training—all explained away as natural talent rather than aristocratic preparation.

But running from destiny is not the same as escaping it. His family searches still, their agents probing northward, seeking the wayward son whose blood they need.

## The Martial Artist

Bob's exceptional fighting ability is not accidental—it's the result of training that began in childhood.

### The Training

His family, believing he needed to be physically perfect for his ceremonial role, provided exceptional instruction:
- Master martial artists teaching styles that blend Spanish sword arts with indigenous combat techniques
- Discipline and conditioning that pushed his body beyond normal limits
- Education in violence as both practical skill and sacred art
- Training methods that incorporated ritual and supernatural elements

The fighting style he learned predates the Spanish conquest, passed down through generations of noble warriors, preserved in his family's secret training halls.

### The Supernatural Edge

What Bob doesn't fully understand is that his bloodline carries more than genetic legacy. The old powers his family worships have marked him, and that marking manifests in physical capabilities that exceed normal human limits:

**Enhanced Durability**: He's tougher than he should be—not obviously supernatural, but consistently surviving impacts that should break bones or kill.

**Unnatural Recovery**: Injuries heal faster than they should, fatigue lifts more quickly, and his body seems to find reserves that shouldn't exist.

**Intuitive Combat Sense**: Sometimes Bob knows where attacks are coming from before they arrive, moves without conscious thought, reacts faster than reflexes should allow.

**Supernatural Strength**: In moments of need, he demonstrates strength beyond his physical build—not constantly, but in critical moments when normal human capacity wouldn't suffice.

These advantages are subtle enough that observers attribute them to exceptional training and natural toughness. Bob himself doesn't fully acknowledge their supernatural nature, preferring to believe his abilities are purely physical.

## The Near-Death Awakening

Several months ago, Bob's life changed fundamentally through violence and transcendence.

### The Death Experience

During his time drifting through the Southwest, Bob took a job that went catastrophically wrong. The specifics remain traumatic:
- Violence that should have been simple turned deadly
- Wounds that should have been survivable proved fatal
- His body broken, his blood soaking into desert sand
- Medical science says he should have died

But instead of dying, Bob found himself somewhere else.

### The Spirit Realm

The Aztecs called it Mictlan, the land of the dead. Shamans know it as the spirit world. Bob, dying in the physical world, walked among spirits and forces that his rational mind insisted could not exist.

What he experienced there:
- **Entities that recognized his bloodline**: Spirits that spoke to him in languages he shouldn't understand but somehow did
- **Visions of ancient powers**: The old gods his family worships, vast and terrible, existing in ways that defy description
- **Bargains offered**: Forces that wanted to claim him, use him, bind him to purposes he couldn't comprehend
- **The choice to return**: Something—his will, his destiny, or forces he doesn't understand—allowed him to come back

And then he woke up, alive, his wounds already beginning to heal at impossible speeds.

### The Shamanic Awakening

Since his near-death experience, Bob has discovered capabilities he never possessed before. His hexes manifest as practical, physical effects:

**Hangover**: He can afflict targets with debilitating weakness, as if they suffered terrible intoxication.

**Get Up**: When knocked down, Bob rises with impossible speed and resilience, shrugging off impacts that should keep him down.

**Sleep**: Through will alone, Bob can force targets into unconsciousness, their bodies suddenly overwhelmed by irresistible fatigue.

**Throwin' People**: When Bob throws someone, physics cooperates beyond normal human strength—opponents sail further, hit harder, than momentum should allow.

**Mule Kick**: His strikes carry supernatural force, as if his blows channel power from beyond the physical.

**Inspired**: In moments of crisis, Bob can push beyond normal human capacity, finding reserves of strength, speed, and endurance that shouldn't exist.

### The Terrible Understanding

Bob's shamanic awakening confirms his worst fears about his family's beliefs: the old powers are real. The gods they worship exist. The ceremonies they perform tap into genuine supernatural forces.

Everything he ran from wasn't superstition or family madness—it was terrible truth.

This realization brings new horror: if the powers are real, then the sacrifice his family plans might actually work. His blood might truly serve the purpose they intend. Running might not be enough to escape a destiny that involves cosmic forces beyond human understanding.

## The Constant Struggle

Bob's existence since his awakening involves multiple layers of deception and internal conflict:

### Hiding the Noble Heritage

Every interaction requires maintaining his working-class persona:
- Suppressing educated speech patterns
- Hiding knowledge of literature, history, and culture
- Rough manners covering aristocratic training
- Constant vigilance against slips that might reveal his background

The wrong reference, the wrong phrase, the wrong display of knowledge—any could lead to questions that expose his true identity.

### Hiding the Shamanic Powers

The awakening creates new complications:
- Using hexes while making them seem like luck or skill
- Experiencing supernatural phenomena while maintaining skeptical demeanor  
- Seeing spirits and forces invisible to others while pretending normalcy
- Resisting the pull toward deeper exploration of his powers

Bob doesn't want to be a shaman. He doesn't want to acknowledge the supernatural. He wants to be normal, human, free of cosmic destiny. But the powers continue manifesting, and denying them becomes harder each day.

### The Internal War

Bob fights constant internal battles:

**Against his bloodline**: The powers marked in his blood pull him toward his family's destiny, whispering that resistance is futile.

**Against the spirits**: Entities from the spirit realm increasingly notice him, attempt to communicate, offer bargains he doesn't want to hear.

**Against his powers**: Each use of shamanic abilities strengthens the connection to forces he'd rather reject entirely.

**Against despair**: The knowledge that everything he fled was real, that running might be impossible, that destiny might be inescapable.

## The Hunted

Bob's family has not abandoned their search. As the supernatural awakening spreads across America following Gettysburg, they've gained new resources and urgency:

### Family Agents

His family's search for him involves:
- Mundane agents asking questions in border towns
- Brujos using ritual to track bloodlines
- Supernatural entities bound to his family's service
- Networks of informants paid to watch for someone matching his description

### The Probing Attacks

Some of the "accidents" and strange encounters Bob has experienced weren't random:
- The ambush that nearly killed him and triggered his awakening
- Mysterious figures who seem to recognize him before disappearing
- Dreams that feel like invasions from external forces
- Moments when he feels watched by invisible eyes

Bob doesn't know which incidents represent his family's agents and which are simply frontier dangers, but the paranoia is justified—they are hunting him.

### The Growing Urgency

The supernatural awakening makes his family's ceremony more viable than ever:
- The old gods stir in response to the death and fear of the Civil War
- Rituals that once required decades of preparation now work with months
- The boundary between worlds grows thinner, making contact easier
- His family believes this is their prophesied moment

They need Bob's blood now more than ever, and they have more tools than ever to find him.

## The Railroad Refuge

Bob's position with the Vanderbilt Continental Express serves multiple survival purposes:

**Anonymity**: Among hundreds of workers, he's just another face, another name, another hired hand whose past is his own business.

**Movement**: The railroad's constant westward progress keeps him ahead of pursuers, never staying in one place long enough for searchers to close in.

**Purpose**: Fighting for the railroad, protecting workers, doing honest work—these give meaning to a life spent running and help him maintain humanity against supernatural corruption.

**Community**: Despite his isolation, working alongside others provides human connection that grounds him, reminds him why he fights against his family's plans.

**Cover**: The rough, violent work of railroad security explains his combat abilities without raising questions about noble training or supernatural enhancement.

## The Secrets He Cannot Share

Bob lives with multiple layers of dangerous truth that he must never reveal:

### About His Heritage

If his noble background were exposed:
- His family would know exactly where to find him
- Others might try to sell information about his location
- Questions about why he fled would lead to uncomfortable truths about human sacrifice
- His carefully constructed identity would collapse

### About His Powers

If his shamanic awakening were known:
- People would fear him as touched by dark forces
- The superstitious would see him as cursed or evil
- Other supernatural entities would take notice
- Questions about how he awakened would lead to his near-death experience

### About the Old Gods

If people understood that the Aztec gods are real and his family can contact them:
- Panic about supernatural forces most believe are myth
- Questions about what other "mythology" might be real
- Dangerous interest from those seeking to exploit such powers
- Attention from forces—both human and otherwise—that Bob can't handle

## The Future He Fears

Bob knows his current situation is unstable and temporary:

### The Family Will Find Him

It's not a question of if but when. His family has resources, determination, and supernatural assistance. Eventually, they'll narrow the search enough that running won't suffice.

### The Powers Will Grow Stronger

Each use of his shamanic abilities strengthens the connection to the spirit world. Eventually, he may no longer be able to maintain the pretense of normalcy. The supernatural will become too obvious to hide.

### The Choice Will Come

Someday Bob will face a decision:
- Surrender to his family's destiny and die as they intend
- Fight them directly and likely fail against their numbers and power
- Embrace his shamanic powers fully and become something he fears
- Find some third option he hasn't yet conceived

### The Corruption He Dreads

Bob fears not just physical death but spiritual corruption. The powers he touches are old, alien, and fundamentally inhuman. Each time he channels them, each time he walks in the spirit realm, each time he uses the abilities his bloodline grants—he risks becoming something other than human, losing himself to forces he cannot control.

## The Man Behind the Masks

Bob maintains multiple false faces:

**To His Coworkers**: A dangerous but reliable drifter with mysterious past and exceptional fighting skills.

**To Himself (Sometimes)**: A normal man with training and natural toughness, denying the supernatural nature of his abilities.

**The Hidden Truth**: A fugitive noble with Aztec royal blood, awakening as a shaman, hunted by his family for ritual sacrifice, fighting against cosmic destiny while his supernatural powers grow stronger daily.

The real Bob exists somewhere between these identities—a man who wants nothing more than to be normal, free, and human, but who carries bloodline, destiny, and powers that make such simple wishes impossible.

He walks westward with the railroad, using violence to protect others, trying to do good with powers drawn from ancient sources, and hoping that running will somehow be enough—knowing that eventually, the past, the family, and the old gods will catch up with him.

When that day comes, Bob will have to make a choice: die as his family intends, fight and likely perish, or embrace the shamanic path fully and risk losing his humanity to forces beyond mortal understanding.

For now, he fights, he runs, and he pretends—maintaining the fiction of normalcy while the supernatural truth grows harder to deny with each passing day.
