# Cornelius Vanderbilt III

**Born**: March 15, 1839, New York City  
**Occupation**: Railroad Executive, Scion of the Vanderbilt Fortune  
**Current Position**: Operations Director, Vanderbilt Continental Express, Kansas Territory

## Background

Cornelius Vanderbilt III was born into one of America's wealthiest families, third in line after his grandfather (the legendary "Commodore" Vanderbilt) and his father, Cornelius Vanderbilt II. From birth, his life path seemed predetermined: elite education, careful grooming for business leadership, and eventually a comfortable position managing some portion of the vast Vanderbilt empire.

But Cornelius III has always been a disappointment to his father.

## The Vanderbilt Legacy

The Vanderbilt fortune was built on steamships and, increasingly, railroads. The Commodore, now elderly, transformed himself from a ferry operator to one of America's richest men through ruthless business practices and an almost supernatural ability to identify profitable ventures. Cornelius II inherited his father's business acumen but added a mean-spirited miserliness that makes Ebenezer Scrooge look generous by comparison.

Where the Commodore was ruthless but fair to those who proved their worth, Cornelius II treats everyone—family included—as assets to be exploited or liabilities to be minimized. He hoards wealth with pathological intensity, denying his family basic comforts despite possessing millions. His mansion, though grand, is kept deliberately cold to save on coal. His table features simple fare when elaborate meals would be more appropriate for his station. He counts every penny spent on his son's upbringing as an investment that must show proper returns.

## A Son's Burden

Cornelius III grew up under his father's critical eye, constantly measured and found wanting. Too soft. Too generous. Too concerned with others' opinions. Not calculating enough. Not hungry enough for wealth. Not ruthless enough in business.

The comparisons to his grandfather were worse. The Commodore, for all his flaws, possessed charisma and vision. Cornelius III, by contrast, seemed merely adequate—competent at his studies, decent at business matters, but lacking that killer instinct that defined Vanderbilt men.

His father's assessment wasn't entirely wrong. Cornelius III genuinely cares about people in a way that his father considers weakness. He treats servants as human beings. He feels guilt when business decisions harm workers. He questions whether accumulating wealth beyond any possible use is truly life's purpose.

These doubts, carefully hidden, mark him as fundamentally unsuited for Vanderbilt leadership in his father's eyes.

## The Railroad Assignment

When the transcontinental railroad race accelerated in 1863, Cornelius II saw an opportunity. The Vanderbilt Continental Express would be the family's entry into this competition, a venture requiring massive capital investment and operational expertise. Success would bring not just wealth but national prestige and political influence.

For Cornelius III, this represented a chance—perhaps his last chance—to prove himself worthy of the family name.

His father made the stakes brutally clear: succeed in building the railroad, demonstrate Vanderbilt superiority over competitors, and perhaps earn a place in the business empire. Fail, and he would be relegated to some minor position, living off a trust fund while his father found more capable men to manage Vanderbilt interests.

The message was explicit: this was not just a business assignment but a test of his very worth as a human being.

## Money Is No Object

Cornelius III arrived in Kansas Territory with seemingly unlimited resources. His father, despite his miserliness in personal matters, understood that the railroad race required massive capital investment. If spending money could ensure victory, then money would be spent—but only because victory would repay the investment many times over.

This financial backing gives Cornelius III a powerful advantage over competitors. He can hire the best engineers, buy the finest equipment, pay premium wages to attract skilled workers, and overcome obstacles through sheer financial force. Where other railroad companies must carefully budget and make difficult trade-offs, Cornelius can simply throw money at problems until they disappear.

Yet this advantage comes with immense pressure. Every dollar spent is tracked. Every delay is scrutinized. His father's agents send regular reports back to New York, assessing progress, noting inefficiencies, and documenting every decision that seems wasteful or soft-hearted.

## The Man Himself

At 24 years old, Cornelius III presents a complex figure to those who work with him:

**Outwardly Confident**: He carries himself with the bearing expected of a Vanderbilt, speaking with authority and making decisions with apparent certainty. To his workers and business associates, he seems every inch the railroad magnate's son.

**Inwardly Uncertain**: Privately, he constantly second-guesses himself, wondering if he's made the right decisions, worrying whether his concern for workers' welfare will be seen as weakness, and dreading the next critical letter from his father.

**Generous by Necessity**: He treats people well—paying fair wages, ensuring decent conditions, showing personal interest in his workers—not because his father would approve (he wouldn't) but because he cannot force himself to be as cold as Vanderbilt business practices demand.

**Desperate for Approval**: Everything he does is ultimately aimed at winning his father's respect, a goal that seems increasingly hopeless. His father's approval is a mirage that recedes with every achievement.

**Competent but Not Brilliant**: Cornelius III is genuinely good at railroad management. He understands engineering principles, can read maps and surveys, and makes sound operational decisions. But he lacks the visionary brilliance or ruthless innovation that marks truly exceptional leaders.

## Current Situation

In Kansas Territory, Cornelius III drives his operation forward with determined intensity. The Vanderbilt Continental Express lays track at impressive speeds, their well-funded operation making rapid progress westward. But the work is not without challenges:

Rival companies engage in sabotage. Native tribes resist the railroad's advance. The harsh frontier environment tests men and machines. Strange incidents occur—unexplained equipment failures, workers who disappear without trace, reports of impossible things seen in the night.

Cornelius III deals with these challenges as they arise, throwing money and resources at every problem. Yet he increasingly notices things that money cannot fix, phenomena that his rational business education did not prepare him for.

He doesn't speak of these concerns, fearing they would be seen as weakness or evidence that the frontier has broken his nerve. But the question nags at him: what if there are forces at work in this railroad race that go beyond normal business competition?

## The Secret He Doesn't Know

Cornelius III has no idea that the man he calls father is not his biological parent. The resemblance between himself and Jeeves, his loyal butler and bodyguard, is striking to any objective observer—but neither Cornelius nor Jeeves acknowledges it, each for their own reasons.

His mother's indiscretion years ago, the child who resulted, and Cornelius II's decision to raise the boy as his own while secretly knowing the truth—all of this remains hidden. Cornelius II's cruelty toward his "son" takes on darker meaning with this knowledge: he is raising another man's child, investing Vanderbilt money in a boy who carries none of his blood, all while maintaining the pretense for the sake of family reputation.

Whether Jeeves knows the truth, whether he silently watches over his biological son, whether he feels pride or pain at seeing the young man struggle under Vanderbilt expectations—these questions remain unanswered.

## The Mason Connection

Cornelius III knows nothing of his father's involvement with Masonic lodges or secret societies. Cornelius II guards such associations carefully, understanding that business success and occult dabbling should never intersect in public perception.

But the elder Vanderbilt's interest in the railroad goes beyond mere profit. The transcontinental railroad serves purposes that Cornelius III cannot imagine—purposes related to ley lines, mystical geography, and rituals that have suddenly begun working in ways they never did before.

His father's Masonic connections have learned something about the changes sweeping America after the Battle of Gettysburg, something about how the railroad's route might serve occult purposes. This knowledge drives decisions that seem purely financial but serve deeper aims.

Cornelius III executes his father's orders without understanding their true purpose, an unwitting tool in schemes that would horrify him if he knew their nature.

## Looking Forward

As the railroad pushes westward, Cornelius III faces increasing challenges: supernatural phenomena he cannot explain, competitors who seem to possess uncanny advantages, and a growing sense that the world is not what he thought it was.

His desperate need for his father's approval drives him forward even as the situation grows stranger. He cannot fail. He will not fail. Whatever it takes, he must prove himself worthy of the Vanderbilt name—even if that name belongs to a man who is not truly his father, and even if success requires confronting forces that his rational education insists cannot exist.
