# Global Affairs in 1863

## Europe: A Powder Keg Watching America Burn

### The Great Powers and American Neutrality

Europe's major powers watch America's civil war with a mixture of concern, calculation, and barely concealed satisfaction at seeing the upstart republic tear itself apart.

**Great Britain** maintains official neutrality while its textile mills starve for Southern cotton. The British government carefully balances sympathy for the Confederacy (and desire for a weakened United States) against the political impossibility of supporting slavery and the risk that Union naval power poses to British commerce. The Trent Affair of 1861 brought the nations to the brink of war; both sides remain wary. Liverpool shipyards continue building vessels that mysteriously end up as Confederate raiders, while British diplomats maintain plausible deniability.

**France** under Napoleon III pursues more adventurous policies. Using America's distraction, French forces invaded Mexico in 1862, installing Archduke Maximilian of Austria as emperor in a blatant violation of the Monroe Doctrine. With American power divided, there's little Washington can do beyond issue impotent protests. Napoleon calculates that a permanently divided America serves French interests perfectly—two weaker nations rather than one strong one.

**Russia** alone among European powers openly supports the Union, sending naval squadrons to New York and San Francisco in 1863 in a show of friendship that has more to do with Russian rivalry with Britain than any love for American democracy. Tsar Alexander II, having recently emancipated Russia's serfs, finds common cause with Lincoln's fight against slavery—though Russian peasants might dispute how "free" they truly are.

**Spain** nervously watches its remaining American colonies (Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines) while America's internal chaos emboldens independence movements. Spanish colonial authorities have noticed strange reports from Cuba—unusual religious practices, unexplained disappearances, and rumors of rituals that combine African, Caribbean, and European traditions in disturbing ways.

## The Mexican Adventure

France's Mexican intervention represents Europe's most direct exploitation of American weakness:

**The Occupation**: French troops control Mexico City and major urban centers, propping up Emperor Maximilian's regime against Republican forces led by Benito Juárez. The French Foreign Legion has discovered that Mexico presents unexpected challenges—the country's vast deserts, hostile population, and reported encounters with bandits who seem to possess almost supernatural knowledge of French movements.

**Confederate Connections**: The Confederacy has established informal relations with Maximilian's government, seeing French Mexico as a potential ally and source of supplies. Weapons and goods flow across the Texas-Mexico border in both directions, while Union agents work to disrupt these connections.

**The Republican Resistance**: Juárez's government-in-exile continues fighting from northern Mexico, receiving covert American support when possible. Mexican Republican forces report that the French seem oddly nervous about operating in certain regions, particularly remote areas where indigenous populations practice old traditions.

## The British Empire

### India After the Mutiny

The British Raj has solidified control following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but tensions simmer beneath the surface. Colonial administrators report increasing incidents of unexplained phenomena—holy men demonstrating seemingly impossible abilities, ancient temples where British soldiers refuse to venture, and native princes who seem to know British plans before they're executed.

### The Opium Trade

Britain continues forcing opium on China despite the devastating social costs, maintaining their profitable trade while Chinese authorities struggle helplessly against British naval power. In Chinese ports, British merchants whisper about local secret societies that seem to possess unusual capabilities, and about the "Boxer" martial artists whose abilities defy rational explanation.

### African Colonization

European powers are beginning the "scramble for Africa," with British explorers mapping the continent's interior. David Livingstone's expeditions into central Africa send back reports of natural wonders, but also disturbing accounts of regions where compasses fail, where ancient civilizations left ruins that suggest impossible technologies, and where tribal societies possess knowledge that shouldn't exist.

## The Ottoman Empire: "The Sick Man of Europe"

The Ottoman Empire continues its slow decline, losing territory and influence:

**Balkan Tensions**: Christian populations in the Balkans increasingly agitate for independence from Ottoman Muslim rule. Secret societies proliferate, some dedicated to national liberation, others to more esoteric purposes. European powers manipulate these tensions for advantage, while Ottoman authorities struggle to maintain control.

**Modernization Attempts**: Sultan Abdülaziz attempts to reform and modernize Ottoman institutions, but conservative religious authorities resist. In the empire's remote provinces—Arabia, Kurdistan, the North African territories—Ottoman control is nominal at best. Travelers return with tales of ancient places where time seems to flow differently, of desert tribes who claim descent from djinn, and of ruins older than recorded history.

## Asia Beyond Empire

### China's Taiping Rebellion

The Taiping Rebellion, which began in 1850, continues devastating China. This Christian-influenced movement has claimed tens of millions of lives in what may be history's deadliest civil war. Taiping forces control much of southern China, their leader Hong Xiuquan claiming to be Jesus Christ's younger brother. Western observers report bizarre accounts from the conflict—mass visions, prophetic dreams, and battles where both sides claim divine intervention.

### Japan's Isolation Ending

Following Commodore Perry's arrival in 1853, Japan has been forced to open to Western trade. The Tokugawa shogunate's authority crumbles as samurai debate whether to embrace Western technology or expel the foreign barbarians. In this chaos, ancient traditions clash with modernity. Reports from Japan speak of warrior brotherhoods practicing techniques passed down for centuries, of mountain monasteries where monks achieve seemingly superhuman abilities, and of a society where the supernatural and mundane coexist more openly than in the rationalist West.

## South America

### Paraguay's War

The War of the Triple Alliance (1864-1870) is brewing, which will see Paraguay fight against Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay in a conflict that will devastate the small nation. Brazilian authorities deal with increasing reports of strange occurrences in the Amazon interior—lost expeditions, indigenous tribes with impossible knowledge, and regions where European diseases somehow fail to spread as expected.

### The Amazon Mystery

As rubber trade grows in importance, expeditions push deeper into the Amazon rainforest. Few return with full crews, and those who do bring back tales of lost civilizations, of tribes who commune with forest spirits, and of plants with properties that defy botanical science.

## Global Patterns

Across the world, certain themes emerge that thoughtful observers might notice:

**Ancient Knowledge Resurfaces**: From India to Mexico to the American frontier, reports increase of indigenous peoples demonstrating abilities and knowledge that imperial powers cannot explain. Colonial administrators dismiss these as superstition, yet the reports persist.

**Religious Fervor**: Religious movements intensify globally—from the Taiping in China to evangelical revivals in America to Sufi mysticism in the Ottoman Empire. Prophets and visionaries proliferate, many claiming the end times approach.

**Technological Acceleration**: The Industrial Revolution accelerates, bringing locomotives, telegraphs, and firearms to more of the world. Yet this technological progress seems shadowed by things that technology cannot explain—machines that fail without cause, inventions that work in ways their creators don't understand, and a growing sense that the rational, mechanistic universe is not as solid as philosophers claimed.

**Communication Breaks Down**: The telegraph should be connecting the world, yet messages mysteriously fail, arrive garbled, or contain information they shouldn't. Ships disappear with increasing frequency. Expeditions lose contact. It's as if the world is simultaneously shrinking through technology and expanding through mystery.

## The View from Abroad

For observers in Europe and Asia, America's Civil War represents something more troubling than a typical conflict:

The war should have ended by now. The casualties should have forced compromise. The economic strain should have collapsed one side or both. Yet it continues, feeding on itself, as if sustained by something beyond normal human passion or political calculation.

Some foreign observers, particularly those who have spent time on the American frontier or in other remote regions, wonder if America's internal chaos is part of a larger pattern—a world where old certainties are breaking down, where the boundaries between the possible and impossible are becoming dangerously unclear, and where humanity's confident march of progress faces challenges from forces that rationalist philosophy insists cannot exist.

These thoughts remain largely unspoken in diplomatic dispatches and official reports. But in private letters, in the journals of explorers and missionaries, in the whispered conversations of those who have seen things they cannot explain, a disturbing question emerges: What if the American Civil War isn't just a political conflict, but a symptom of something changing in the world itself?

For now, Europe's powers continue their great game of empire and intrigue, secure in their superiority and the triumph of civilization over superstition. But late at night, in clubs and salons from London to St. Petersburg, men who have traveled widely share uncomfortable stories that suggest the world is not quite as understood as they would like to believe.
