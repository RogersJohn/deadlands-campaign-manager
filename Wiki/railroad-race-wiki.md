# The Transcontinental Railroad Race

## Overview

In the months following the Battle of Gettysburg, America finds itself locked in a grinding civil war with no clear end in sight. Yet even as brother fights brother, the nation's industrial titans have launched an unprecedented competition: the race to complete the first transcontinental railroad. What was once a unified national project has fractured into a chaotic free-for-all, with multiple companies vying to be the first to link the coasts and claim the immense government subsidies, land grants, and commercial monopolies that come with victory.

## The Major Competitors

### Union Pacific Railroad

Operating primarily from Omaha, Nebraska westward, the Union Pacific represents Northern industrial might. Backed by the federal government and Northern industrialists, they employ thousands of Irish immigrants and Union veterans. Their chief advantage is access to Union Army protection and federal funding, though bureaucratic oversight often slows their progress.

### Central Pacific Railroad

Building eastward from Sacramento, California, the Central Pacific has pioneered the use of Chinese laborers who prove remarkably skilled at the dangerous mountain work. Led by the "Big Four" industrialists, they face the daunting challenge of crossing the Sierra Nevada but benefit from California's gold wealth.

### Vanderbilt Continental Express

A new entrant backed by the legendary Vanderbilt fortune, this company operates with seemingly unlimited capital. Young Cornelius Vanderbilt III leads their ambitious Kansas operation, pushing west with reckless speed and the latest equipment money can buy. Rumors suggest the Vanderbilts have powerful backers in secret societies, though such talk is dismissed as the jealous gossip of competitors.

### Louisiana & Pacific Railroad

Operating out of New Orleans, this company represents Southern industrial ambition despite the Confederacy's struggles. Unusually well-funded given the South's economic situation, they employ a mix of freed slaves, Creole workers, and mysterious contract laborers. Whispers circulate about their enigmatic backers, with some claiming Haitian investors have poured money into the venture. Their route aims to cross through Texas and the New Mexico Territory.

### Kansas Pacific Railway

Originally the Union Pacific Eastern Division, this company works westward from Kansas City. Now semi-independent, they compete directly with other lines for the most advantageous routes through Kansas and Colorado, often clashing with Vanderbilt interests.

### Atlantic & Pacific Railroad

Operating from St. Louis with Confederate backing, this line represents the South's attempt to maintain relevance in the transcontinental race despite wartime challenges.

## The Stakes

The race is about far more than steel and steam:

**Government Subsidies**: The federal government (and in Confederate territory, the Richmond government) offers massive financial incentives—up to $48,000 per mile of track in mountain terrain, plus land grants of 6,400 acres per mile.

**Commercial Dominance**: The first line to connect the coasts will control trade routes worth millions annually, from cattle shipping to immigrant transport to mail contracts.

**National Pride**: For the Union, completing the railroad represents the triumph of Northern industry and the inevitable victory of their cause. For the Confederacy, proving they can compete in this race demonstrates their viability as an independent nation.

**Military Significance**: Both governments recognize that transcontinental rail would revolutionize troop movement and supply lines, potentially breaking the current stalemate.

## The Reality on the Ground

The competition has turned brutal:

**Route Sabotage**: Rival companies regularly sabotage each other's survey stakes, bribe local officials, and spread false reports about hostile Indian activity on competitors' routes.

**Labor Conflicts**: Companies poach each other's workers with promises of better pay. Fights between rival work gangs are common, sometimes escalating to deadly violence.

**Engineering Challenges**: The rush to lay track as quickly as possible leads to shoddy construction. Bridges collapse, tunnels cave in, and "temporary" grades wash away in storms. The death toll among workers climbs daily.

**Financial Warfare**: Stock manipulation, bribed newspaper editors, and forged survey reports are standard practice. Several smaller companies have already collapsed under the weight of mysterious financial attacks.

**Native Resistance**: Plains tribes increasingly understand that the "iron horse" threatens their way of life. Raids on work camps grow more frequent and coordinated, though companies often exploit these attacks for publicity and government military support.

## Strange Occurrences

While most dismiss them as frontier superstition, workers increasingly report unsettling incidents:

- Entire work camps found abandoned with breakfast still warm on the plates
- Survey parties returning with wild tales of impossible creatures
- Equipment failures that defy mechanical explanation
- Workers developing unexplained illnesses or claiming to see things that "shouldn't be there"
- Unusual weather patterns seeming to target specific companies

Railroad executives publicly scoff at such stories, attributing them to poorly distilled whiskey and the harsh conditions driving men mad. Yet privately, some companies have begun hiring specialists—men with unusual skills and knowledge—to "consult" on particularly troubled stretches of track.

## Current Status (November 1863)

With the war showing no signs of ending, the railroad race has become a proxy battlefield where North and South compete through industrial might rather than military force. The Vanderbilt Continental Express has made surprising progress, their Kansas operation laying track at unprecedented speeds. Meanwhile, the Louisiana & Pacific's mysterious efficiency has raised eyebrows among competitors.

In Washington and Richmond alike, politicians understand that whoever wins this race may well determine the ultimate victor of the larger war. The transcontinental railroad is no longer just about connecting coasts—it's about proving which vision of America will survive.
