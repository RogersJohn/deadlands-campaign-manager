# John Henry Faraday

**Born**: 1839, Location Unknown
**Occupation**: Medical Doctor
**Current Position**: Medical Officer, Vanderbilt Continental Express

## The Doctor

John Henry Faraday is a properly trained medical doctor with legitimate credentials and qualifications. At 24 years old, he serves the Vanderbilt Continental Express as their medical officer, treating everything from minor injuries to life-threatening trauma with professional competence.

His medical practice follows conventional procedures and recognized techniques. He can discuss medical theory with educated practitioners, understands anatomy and physiology, and treats patients using proper medical science.

Yet despite his conventional training and orthodox methods, John Henry's success rate defies statistical probability. Men who should die from their wounds survive under his care at rates that exceed any normal doctor's experience. Infections that should spread mysteriously clear up. Complications that should arise simply don't occur.

He practices medicine exactly as a qualified doctor should—and somehow achieves results that qualified doctors cannot consistently replicate.

## The Gambler

Beyond his medical practice, John Henry is known as a skilled card player. He frequents the camp's gambling tables when not attending to patients, demonstrating considerable proficiency at poker and other games of chance.

His card handling shows remarkable dexterity—shuffling, dealing, and manipulating cards with practiced ease. Some attribute his gambling success to skill and mathematical probability. Others whisper that his hands move with unusual precision, that cards seem to fall exactly where he wants them, that his shuffles create patterns that favor his play.

John Henry dismisses such speculation with a quiet smile, attributing his success to practice and attention to probability. But those who watch closely notice that he rarely loses when the stakes truly matter, and his card tricks entertain even as they unsettle observers who can't quite follow how he achieves certain effects.

## The Gunfighter

For a medical professional, John Henry demonstrates surprising proficiency with firearms. He wears a revolver with the casual comfort of someone long accustomed to carrying weapons, and camp rumors suggest he's considerably more dangerous in a gunfight than his profession would indicate.

Workers who've witnessed him practice report that he shoots with disturbing accuracy—not the fumbling competence of a doctor who learned to shoot for self-defense, but the practiced skill of someone who's spent serious time developing marksmanship.

He doesn't seek out conflicts, maintains professional courtesy, and generally projects the demeanor of a non-violent medical practitioner. But when pressed, those who've seen him draw suggest that John Henry could hold his own against most professional gunfighters on the frontier.

Where and how a medical doctor developed such combat proficiency remains unclear. John Henry doesn't discuss it, and most don't press the question—in 1863 frontier America, a man's survival skills are his own business.

## The Scars He Carries

Those who work closely with John Henry have noticed he moves with unusual care, though not from obvious pain or disability. When fully clothed, he appears physically sound, showing no visible signs of injury.

However, those who have glimpsed him without his shirt—medical staff assisting with patient treatment, or colleagues in situations requiring physical work—report significant scarring on his torso. The marks suggest severe trauma from some catastrophic injury, though the specifics remain unclear.

John Henry does not discuss these scars. Questions about their origin receive polite deflection or professional redirection to other topics. The wounds themselves have healed completely—no infection, no ongoing complications, just the permanent marks of whatever violence occurred.

What's puzzling is how thoroughly healed these injuries appear. For scars of such severity, one would expect ongoing medical complications, reduced physical capability, or at least some visible difficulty with certain movements. John Henry demonstrates none of these limitations, moving with full range of motion and showing no signs of the trauma that must have caused such extensive scarring.

## The Personal Mystery

John Henry's background remains deliberately vague. He appeared in Kansas Territory with proper medical credentials, references that checked out (though the people providing those references are curiously difficult to locate now), and skills that proved themselves immediately.

Questions about his past receive polite but firm deflection:

- Where did he train? "Back East, various medical schools."
- Why did he come West? "Better opportunities for someone with medical skills."
- How did he learn to shoot so well? "Practical necessity on the frontier."
- Where did he develop his card playing skills? "Practice and study of probability."
- Does he have family? "No one who concerns anyone here."

This deliberate opacity suggests someone running from something, hiding from someone, or protecting secrets that others might exploit. His colleagues respect his privacy even as they speculate about what he's hiding.

## The Character Himself

Those who work with John Henry describe him as:

**Professionally Competent**: As a doctor, John Henry is skilled, thorough, and dedicated. He treats patients with appropriate medical procedures and genuine care for their welfare.

**Socially Reserved**: John Henry maintains clear boundaries between professional relationships and personal life. He's courteous, helpful, and reliable—but not friendly in a way that invites intimacy.

**Surprisingly Dangerous**: Despite his medical profession and generally peaceful demeanor, John Henry projects an undercurrent of capability that makes smart people cautious about pressing him too hard.

**Intellectually Sharp**: John Henry thinks quickly, observes carefully, and processes information with practiced efficiency. Both at the poker table and in medical diagnosis, he demonstrates keen analytical ability.

**Quietly Confident**: John Henry knows he's good at what he does. He doesn't boast or seek recognition, but neither does he defer to others whose knowledge or capability is inferior to his own.

**Slightly Unsettling**: There's something about John Henry that makes people simultaneously trust his competence and feel vaguely uncomfortable. The way he moves, the way he watches, the way cards fall in his favor—something doesn't quite add up to a conventional frontier doctor, even a skilled one.

**Haunted**: There's a quality to John Henry that suggests he's seen and experienced things that changed him fundamentally. He sometimes looks at nothing with an expression of deep concern, as if remembering or sensing something invisible to others.

## Current Situation

As the Vanderbilt Continental Express pushes westward, John Henry serves as their primary medical officer. The railroad's dangerous work generates steady need for his services, and his remarkable success rate makes him increasingly valuable to the operation.

His dual reputation as both doctor and dangerous man provides certain advantages—workers trust him to treat their injuries, while potential troublemakers think twice about causing problems that might bring them to his attention.

For now, John Henry continues his work—healing the wounded, winning at cards, and carefully avoiding questions about his past, his unusual success rate, or the haunted look that sometimes crosses his face when he thinks no one is watching.
