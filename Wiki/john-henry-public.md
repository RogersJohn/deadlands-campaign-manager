# John Henry Faraday

**Born**: 1839, Location Unknown  
**Occupation**: Gunsmith, Inventor, Medical Practitioner  
**Current Position**: Technical Specialist and Medical Officer, Vanderbilt Continental Express

## The Man Who Fixes What's Broken

John Henry Faraday is something rare in 1863 America—a man with technical expertise across multiple disciplines, respected for his skills even as his unconventional methods raise eyebrows among those trained in traditional crafts. At 24 years old, he serves the Vanderbilt Continental Express as their primary gunsmith and, increasingly, as their medical specialist, though his techniques often defy conventional explanation.

There's something about John Henry that makes people simultaneously trust his competence and feel slightly uncomfortable, as if they sense without understanding that his knowledge comes from sources that proper education doesn't explain.

## The Healer and Inventor

John Henry's reputation rests primarily on two skills: his ability to repair and modify firearms, and his uncanny success in treating injuries that conventional medicine considers hopeless.

His medical treatments work—that's the undeniable truth that overcomes skepticism. Men who should die from their wounds survive under John Henry's care. Infections that should spread mysteriously clear up. Injuries that conventional medicine would treat through amputation heal with limbs intact, though John Henry's methods involve strange contraptions, unusual substances, and procedures that no medical school would recognize.

He doesn't claim formal medical training, instead speaking vaguely of "practical experience" and "extensive reading of advanced texts." His workshop contains medical equipment of unusual design—devices that seem to accelerate healing, implements that appear to diagnose conditions through means that existing science cannot explain, and strange apparatuses whose purposes remain mysterious even to those who witness their use.

When pressed about his methods, John Henry becomes evasive, deflecting questions with technical jargon that sounds almost plausible but never quite explains how his treatments achieve their impossible results.

## The Gunsmith's Trade

John Henry's public identity centers on his work as a gunsmith—a profession that provides both income and respectability on the frontier.

He can repair any firearm, modify weapons to improve their performance, and even design custom pieces for specific purposes. His workshop in the railroad camp is a marvel of precision tools and carefully organized components, and workers quickly learn that bringing a malfunctioning weapon to John Henry means it will return working better than when it was new.

The weapons he modifies work exceptionally well—pistols that never seem to misfire, rifles with uncanny accuracy, shotguns that pattern more tightly than mechanics should allow. He explains these improvements through technical language about barrel rifling, trigger mechanisms, and ammunition selection, and most accept these explanations because they want to believe their enhanced weapons result from superior craftsmanship.

## The Equipment Crafter

Beyond weapons and medicine, John Henry has demonstrated ability to create or repair almost any mechanical device. Give him access to materials and tools, and he can solve technical problems that stump trained engineers:

- Communication devices that work more reliably than standard equipment
- Lighting systems that burn brighter and longer than conventional lamps
- Analytical instruments that detect problems before they become failures
- Protective gear that seems unusually effective

His workshop has become essential to the Vanderbilt Continental Express's operations. When engineers face technical challenges, they increasingly turn to John Henry for solutions. When equipment fails mysteriously, John Henry often manages to repair it even when the cause of failure defies explanation.

## Recent Injury

Those who work closely with John Henry have noticed that he moves more carefully than a man his age should, sometimes grimacing with pain during physical exertion. He bears visible scars that suggest recent serious injury, though he deflects questions about their origin with polite but firm boundaries.

The specifics of what happened remain his private business, but the effects are clear—whatever trauma he endured has left lasting marks both physical and psychological. Some speculate about the cause:

- An experiment that went catastrophically wrong?
- An attack by hostile forces?
- Simple frontier violence?
- A construction accident during previous employment?

John Henry doesn't discuss it, and those who press too hard find themselves politely but firmly redirected to other topics.

## The Personal Mystery

John Henry's background remains deliberately vague. He appeared in Kansas Territory with credentials as a gunsmith, references that checked out (though the people providing those references are curiously difficult to locate now), and skills that proved themselves immediately.

Questions about his past receive polite but firm deflection:

- Where did he train? "Various workshops in the East."
- How did he develop his medical knowledge? "Practical experience and extensive reading."
- Why did he come West? "Better opportunities for someone with technical skills."
- Does he have family? "No one who concerns anyone here."

This deliberate opacity suggests someone running from something, hiding from someone, or protecting secrets that others might exploit. His colleagues respect his privacy even as they speculate about what he's hiding.

## The Character Himself

Those who work with John Henry describe him as:

**Intensely Focused**: When John Henry works on a project, he gives it total attention, blocking out distractions with almost supernatural concentration.

**Professionally Distant**: John Henry maintains clear boundaries between his professional relationships and personal life. He's courteous, helpful, and reliable—but not friendly in a way that invites intimacy.

**Surprisingly Compassionate**: Despite his emotional distance, John Henry shows genuine care for those he treats medically. He stays with dying men, offers comfort to the frightened, and works desperately to save lives even when conventional wisdom says the effort is futile.

**Intellectually Curious**: John Henry constantly experiments, reads whatever technical literature he can obtain, and asks questions about phenomena others take for granted. His workshop contains books on subjects ranging from metallurgy to anatomy to theoretical philosophy.

**Quietly Confident**: John Henry knows he's good at what he does. He doesn't boast or seek recognition, but neither does he defer to "experts" whose knowledge is inferior to his.

**Protective of His Methods**: John Henry allows people to watch him work on weapons, but his medical treatments happen behind closed doors. He's very particular about who assists him and becomes evasive when questioned too closely about his techniques.

**Haunted**: There's a quality to John Henry that suggests he's seen and experienced things that changed him fundamentally. He sometimes looks at nothing with an expression of deep concern, as if remembering or seeing something invisible to others.

## Current Situation

As the Vanderbilt Continental Express pushes westward, John Henry finds himself increasingly essential to the operation. The railroad faces not just conventional challenges but increasingly strange problems that conventional solutions cannot address.

Equipment fails in ways that defy mechanical explanation. Workers fall ill with maladies that don't match known diseases. Accidents occur with suspicious frequency and timing. In each case, John Henry somehow manages to identify and solve problems that others cannot even properly diagnose.

His value to the operation grows daily, though this increased visibility comes with risks. The more essential he becomes, the more questions arise about his unusual capabilities, and the harder it becomes to maintain the fiction of conventional expertise.

For now, John Henry continues his work—fixing what's broken, healing what's wounded, and carefully avoiding questions about exactly how he achieves results that seem to defy natural law. But those who watch closely suspect that the frontier gunsmith and healer carries secrets far deeper than mere technical expertise, secrets that might explain both his remarkable abilities and the haunted look that sometimes crosses his face when he thinks no one is watching.
