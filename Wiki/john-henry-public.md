# John Henry Faraday

**Born**: 1839, Location Unknown
**Occupation**: Medical Doctor, Gunsmith, Technical Specialist
**Current Position**: Medical Officer and Technical Specialist, Vanderbilt Continental Express

## The Doctor Who Knows Too Much

John Henry Faraday is a properly trained medical doctor, with credentials and qualifications that check out when examined. At 24 years old, he serves the Vanderbilt Continental Express as their medical officer, treating everything from minor injuries to life-threatening trauma with competence that reflects genuine professional training.

What makes John Henry unusual isn't a lack of proper education—it's that his medical capabilities seem to exceed what any school could have taught him. There's something about his treatments that achieves results conventional medicine cannot explain, even when performed by a qualified physician.

## The Trained Physician

John Henry's medical credentials are legitimate. He completed formal medical training, holds proper qualifications, and can discuss medical theory with educated practitioners. When treating patients, he uses recognized techniques, proper terminology, and conventional procedures.

Yet his success rate defies statistical probability. Men who should die from their wounds survive under John Henry's care at rates that exceed any normal doctor's experience. Infections that should spread mysteriously clear up. Complications that should arise simply don't occur.

He practices medicine exactly as a qualified doctor should—and somehow achieves results that qualified doctors cannot replicate.

## The New Technical Skills

More recently, John Henry has demonstrated unexpected proficiency with mechanical and technical work, particularly firearms modification and equipment repair. This represents a dramatic expansion of his capabilities beyond his medical training.

His gunsmithing work is remarkable considering he never formally trained in the profession. He can repair any firearm, modify weapons to improve their performance, and even design custom pieces. His workshop contains precision tools he seems to have acquired recently, and workers notice that he approaches mechanical problems with the same intense focus he brings to medicine—and achieves similarly improbable results.

The weapons he modifies work exceptionally well. Pistols that never seem to misfire, rifles with uncanny accuracy, shotguns that pattern more tightly than mechanics should allow. When asked where he learned gunsmithing, John Henry becomes vague, mentioning "recent necessity" and "natural aptitude with mechanisms."

This sudden technical expertise puzzles those who knew him before. Where did a medical doctor acquire such advanced mechanical skills? Why did these abilities emerge only recently? John Henry deflects such questions with professional courtesy but offers no satisfying explanations.

## The Gunsmith's Trade

John Henry's public identity centers on his work as a gunsmith—a profession that provides both income and respectability on the frontier.

He can repair any firearm, modify weapons to improve their performance, and even design custom pieces for specific purposes. His workshop in the railroad camp is a marvel of precision tools and carefully organized components, and workers quickly learn that bringing a malfunctioning weapon to John Henry means it will return working better than when it was new.

The weapons he modifies work exceptionally well—pistols that never seem to misfire, rifles with uncanny accuracy, shotguns that pattern more tightly than mechanics should allow. He explains these improvements through technical language about barrel rifling, trigger mechanisms, and ammunition selection, and most accept these explanations because they want to believe their enhanced weapons result from superior craftsmanship.

## The Equipment Crafter

Beyond weapons and medicine, John Henry has demonstrated ability to create or repair almost any mechanical device. Give him access to materials and tools, and he can solve technical problems that stump trained engineers:

- Communication devices that work more reliably than standard equipment
- Lighting systems that burn brighter and longer than conventional lamps
- Analytical instruments that detect problems before they become failures
- Protective gear that seems unusually effective

His workshop has become essential to the Vanderbilt Continental Express's operations. When engineers face technical challenges, they increasingly turn to John Henry for solutions. When equipment fails mysteriously, John Henry often manages to repair it even when the cause of failure defies explanation.

## The Scars He Carries

Those who work closely with John Henry have noticed he moves with unusual care, though not from obvious pain or disability. When fully clothed, he appears physically sound, showing no visible signs of injury.

However, those who have glimpsed him without his shirt—medical staff assisting with patient treatment, or colleagues in situations requiring physical work—report significant scarring on his torso. The marks suggest severe trauma from some catastrophic injury, though the specifics remain unclear.

John Henry does not discuss these scars. Questions about their origin receive polite deflection or professional redirection to other topics. The wounds themselves have healed completely—no infection, no ongoing complications, just the permanent marks of whatever violence occurred.

What's puzzling is how thoroughly healed these injuries appear. For scars of such severity, one would expect ongoing medical complications, reduced physical capability, or at least some visible difficulty with certain movements. John Henry demonstrates none of these limitations, moving with full range of motion and showing no signs of the trauma that must have caused such extensive scarring.

It's yet another mystery about a man who seems to collect them.

## The Personal Mystery

John Henry's background remains deliberately vague. He appeared in Kansas Territory with credentials as a gunsmith, references that checked out (though the people providing those references are curiously difficult to locate now), and skills that proved themselves immediately.

Questions about his past receive polite but firm deflection:

- Where did he train? "Various workshops in the East."
- How did he develop his medical knowledge? "Practical experience and extensive reading."
- Why did he come West? "Better opportunities for someone with technical skills."
- Does he have family? "No one who concerns anyone here."

This deliberate opacity suggests someone running from something, hiding from someone, or protecting secrets that others might exploit. His colleagues respect his privacy even as they speculate about what he's hiding.

## The Character Himself

Those who work with John Henry describe him as:

**Intensely Focused**: When John Henry works on a project, he gives it total attention, blocking out distractions with almost supernatural concentration.

**Professionally Distant**: John Henry maintains clear boundaries between his professional relationships and personal life. He's courteous, helpful, and reliable—but not friendly in a way that invites intimacy.

**Surprisingly Compassionate**: Despite his emotional distance, John Henry shows genuine care for those he treats medically. He stays with dying men, offers comfort to the frightened, and works desperately to save lives even when conventional wisdom says the effort is futile.

**Intellectually Curious**: John Henry constantly experiments, reads whatever technical literature he can obtain, and asks questions about phenomena others take for granted. His workshop contains books on subjects ranging from metallurgy to anatomy to theoretical philosophy.

**Quietly Confident**: John Henry knows he's good at what he does. He doesn't boast or seek recognition, but neither does he defer to "experts" whose knowledge is inferior to his.

**Protective of His Methods**: John Henry allows people to watch him work on weapons, but his medical treatments happen behind closed doors. He's very particular about who assists him and becomes evasive when questioned too closely about his techniques.

**Haunted**: There's a quality to John Henry that suggests he's seen and experienced things that changed him fundamentally. He sometimes looks at nothing with an expression of deep concern, as if remembering or seeing something invisible to others.

## Current Situation

As the Vanderbilt Continental Express pushes westward, John Henry finds himself increasingly essential to the operation. The railroad faces not just conventional challenges but increasingly strange problems that conventional solutions cannot address.

Equipment fails in ways that defy mechanical explanation. Workers fall ill with maladies that don't match known diseases. Accidents occur with suspicious frequency and timing. In each case, John Henry somehow manages to identify and solve problems that others cannot even properly diagnose.

His value to the operation grows daily, though this increased visibility comes with risks. The more essential he becomes, the more questions arise about his unusual capabilities, and the harder it becomes to maintain the fiction of conventional expertise.

For now, John Henry continues his work—fixing what's broken, healing what's wounded, and carefully avoiding questions about exactly how he achieves results that seem to defy natural law. But those who watch closely suspect that the frontier gunsmith and healer carries secrets far deeper than mere technical expertise, secrets that might explain both his remarkable abilities and the haunted look that sometimes crosses his face when he thinks no one is watching.
