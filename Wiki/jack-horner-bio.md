## The Old Geezer Who Won't Quit

At 40 years old, Jack Horner is already considered an old-timer by frontier standards—a ragged, weathered man who looks significantly older than his years. He walks with a limp that slows him down none, seeming tougher than boiled boot leather despite a body that's taken decades of hard living. There's something about Jack that makes younger men instinctively respect him, a quality that suggests he can get real mean when riled up.

He likes his booze and can get downright nasty when drunk, but he doesn't get drunk in the evenin' anymore—he's learned that much, at least.

## Frontier Beginnings

Jack was born when Missouri was still officially "Missourah Territory," in a two-horse town called Knotta City where the Kansas River joins the mighty Missourah. It was young country back then, just north of where the Kansas joins in, barely twenty years after Lewis and Clark passed through.

There was nothin' particularly remarkable about his early years. He worked in his pa's general store, playing in the fields and river banks like many others, not helping much with the family business. The War of 1812 didn't make no durn difference to him—too young to understand, too far west to care much about what the government back east was fighting about.

His story only gets interestin' when he heard about gold found in California in late '48.

## The California Dream

Jack was 25 when news of the California gold strike reached Missouri. Something stirred in him—a hunger for fortune, an urge to escape the settled life his father planned for him, a need to prove himself against the frontier. He decided he'd try his teeth at minin', and reckoned he could do it alongside his older brother Randy Robinson, his partner since they were knee-high to a whipper-snapper.

They planned and prepared all winter. Once the snow melted, they set out across the plains and mountains, part of the great tide of forty-niners seeking fortune in California's rivers and hills.

## Ten Years of Gold

Jack and Randy did well for themselves—not spectacularly, not enough to become legends, but steady minin' and prospectin' for almost ten years in the Sierra Nevada. They learned the trade properly, developed an eye for geology and promising claims, and built up a modest stake through hard work and knowin' when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em.

The work was brutal, dangerous, and often unrewarding. More men failed than succeeded. But Jack had a gift for reading the land, understanding where gold was likely to be, and the stubborn persistence to keep working claims that other men abandoned. He and Randy made it work through partnership—Randy handling the business side, Jack focusing on the actual geology and extraction.

Toward '58, prospectin' was getting' more difficult and yieldin' less. The easy gold was gone, and what remained required industrial-scale operations beyond what two men with hand tools could manage. Jack and Randy had been talkin' about packin' it in, headin' home to settle with their modest profits and a decade of experience that would serve them well in whatever came next.

Then they heard about the Piles Peak gold strike in Colorado.

## The Colorado Betrayal

Jack and Randy figured Colorado is kinda on the way home—they could stop there, prospect for a few seasons, and see if they could build on their California success before finally settling down. It seemed like a perfect capstone to their mining career.

They sold their California claim to one of the gold mining consortiums that were taking over more and more of the business. The sale provided them with a sizeable operation fund—enough to set up properly in Colorado's Clear Creek canyon near Denver.

Things went smoothly for several years. Then came a rabbit on croton oil, metaphorically speaking.

Jack doesn't talk much about exactly what happened, but the essentials are clear: there was a blast early one morning that went off prematurely. Jack woke to find his left leg trapped under a pile of rubble, nobody around to help him. It took a long while for Jack to dig his leg from under the pile with just his hands—agonizing work, alone, wondering if he'd ever get free.

By the time he managed to extract himself, limpin' about, the claim was nearly empty. All the workers had cleared out, all the equipment and valuables had gone off. A posse arrived soon after and claimed Jack was trespassin' on land belongin' to the Colorado & Clear Creek Railroad.

## The Land Theft

After a lot of yellin', shoutin', and cussin', it became clear what had happened: Randy Robinson had sold the land to the Colorado & Clear Creek Railroad before disappearing completely. He'd cleared all the valuables before the sale, pocketed the money, and vanished, leaving Jack with nothing but a worked-out hole in the ground and a pile of debt.

Jack was unceremoniously escorted off what he had thought was his land, roughed up by the railroad's strong-boys when he tried to protest, and thrown out with nothing but the clothes on his back and his boots.

The betrayal cut deeper than any physical injury. Randy wasn't just his business partner—he was his brother, someone Jack had trusted since childhood, the man he'd stood beside for over a decade through the hardships of frontier mining. And Randy had deliberately planned this, setting up the "accident," timing the sale, making sure Jack would be trapped and helpless while the theft was completed.

It was madder than a hornet, finding out his sidewindin', bushwhackin', hornswaglin' traitor of a former friend was gonna try to murder him and steal his loot.

## The $500 and a Long Journey

Luckily, Randy hadn't known about the $500 emergency money Jack had stashed away—a precaution against disaster that turned out to be the difference between destitution and survival. Jack hightailed it back to Denver, got himself some gear, and formed into the office of the Colorado & Clear Creek Railroad demandin' his land back.

Other than makin' a nuisance of himself and shootin' a hole in the ceiling, he got nowhere. The railroad's strong-boys overpowered him, roughed him up good, and threw him out onto the street. When Jack calmed down enough to think clearly, he remembered somethin' important: the Sherriff was the railroad owner's brother-in-law. There would be no justice here, not for a lone prospector against connected interests.

Jack figured it would be better for him to leave town while he still could.

Some folk he knew told him that Randy had talked about goin' home to join the militia—though nobody could say for which side, Union or Confederate. Jack figured Randy was just lookin' for a chance to do some lootin' and pillagin', using the war as cover for his natural inclinations toward theft and violence.

But Randy's money was runnin' low, and the war provided opportunities for men with no scruples.

## The Hunt Begins

Jack arrived in Lawrence, Kansas after traveling through a state that wasn't even a territory when he left, a place torn by the Civil War and years of border violence. So far, there was no sign of Randy Robinson, and Jack's money was runnin' low from the travel and failed searches.

He needed work. He needed information. And he needed revenge.

## The Railroad Connection

When the Vanderbilt Continental Express began recruiting for their Kansas operation, Jack saw an opportunity. Railroads needed geologists and surveyors who understood terrain, rock formations, and the best routes for laying track. His decade in California and years in Colorado had given him exactly those skills.

More importantly, the railroad grapevine carried information. Workers moved between companies, talked about what they'd seen and heard, gossiped about personnel at competing lines. If Randy had joined another railroad operation, Jack would eventually hear about it through the network of railroad workers who moved across the frontier.

Cornelius Vanderbilt III hired Jack based on his obvious expertise and experience. The young railroad executive saw a competent professional who could identify the best routes, predict geological problems, and save the company time and money through proper surveying. He had no idea about Jack's personal vendetta or the darkness driving the old prospector's determination.

Jack threw himself into the work with intensity that impressed his coworkers. He was thorough, careful, and seemingly tireless despite his age and limp. What Cornelius saw as dedication to the job, Jack knew as strategic positioning—every mile of track surveyed was another opportunity to gather information, every camp was another place to ask questions, every interaction with workers from other companies was a chance to learn about Randy's whereabouts.

## The New Orleans Discovery

Eventually, Jack's persistence paid off. Through the railroad grapevine, he learned that Randy Robinson was working for the Louisiana & Pacific Railroad, the New Orleans-based company pushing westward in competition with the Vanderbilt line.

The news hit Jack like a physical blow. Randy wasn't just alive and free—he was working for a direct competitor, using Jack's stolen money to fund his new life, probably laughing about how he'd outsmarted his former partner.

The discovery transformed Jack's employment from opportunistic positioning to personal mission. Now he wasn't just working for the Vanderbilt Continental Express; he was working against Randy Robinson's railroad. Every mile Jack's company laid was a mile ahead of Randy's operation. Every success for Vanderbilt was a setback for the man who'd betrayed him.

Jack began paying special attention to intelligence about the Louisiana & Pacific's operations, noting their progress, identifying their challenges, and looking for any opportunity to slow them down or give Vanderbilt an advantage.

## The Baron Samedi Connection

What Jack doesn't fully understand yet is that the Louisiana & Pacific Railroad is not just another competing company. The line is backed by Baron Samedi, the Haitian loa of death and resurrection, whose influence has grown since the supernatural awakening following Gettysburg.

Randy Robinson, always an opportunist, has fallen in with forces far darker than simple corporate greed. Whether Randy understands what he's working for, whether he's been corrupted or simply doesn't care about his employer's supernatural nature, Jack doesn't know.

But the Louisiana & Pacific's strange efficiency, their uncanny ability to overcome obstacles, and the unsettling reports about their work camps suggest something beyond normal railroad operations. Workers who've escaped from their crews tell stories about night rituals, about overseers who never seem to sleep, about accidents that kill men who then seem to keep working.

Jack dismisses most of this as typical frontier superstition, but he's noticed things that don't quite add up. The Louisiana & Pacific progresses too smoothly, overcomes obstacles too easily, and seems to possess information about competing companies' plans before decisions are even made.

## The Man He's Become

Four decades of frontier life have shaped Jack into a particular type of man:

**Tough**: Pain is an old companion. His limp doesn't slow him down because he's learned to work through discomfort. He can take hits that would drop younger men.

**Bitter**: The betrayal by his own brother poisoned something in Jack's soul. He trusts slowly and doubts quickly, always waiting for people to reveal their true selfish nature.

**Competent**: Jack knows his business—geology, surveying, prospecting, and survival. He's forgotten more about reading terrain than most people ever learn.

**Vengeful**: The desire for retribution against Randy Robinson drives Jack more than any amount of money Vanderbilt could pay. It's become the defining purpose of his life.

**Rough**: Jack has no social graces and doesn't pretend otherwise. He's blunt, profane, and doesn't waste words on politeness. He likes his booze, though he's learned to moderate his drinking—mostly.

**Loyal (to those who earn it)**: Once Jack decides someone is trustworthy, he's absolutely reliable. He'll stand by proven friends with the same intensity he pursues proven enemies.

**Old Before His Time**: At 40, Jack looks and feels older—decades of hard living etched into his weathered face and aching joints. But there's vitality in him yet, fueled by anger and purpose.

## Current Situation

Jack works for the Vanderbilt Continental Express with dedication that has nothing to do with company loyalty and everything to do with personal vendetta. Every geological survey, every route recommendation, every mile of track represents another step toward eventual confrontation with Randy Robinson.

He's noticed increasingly strange occurrences as the railroad pushes west—phenomena that his practical mind struggles to explain. Tools that shouldn't break do. Surveys that should work don't. Sometimes, late at night, he swears he sees things moving in the darkness that ain't quite right.

Jack dismisses these concerns, focusing instead on the concrete goal of finding Randy and getting his money back—plus some retribution doled out for good measure. The idea that the railroad race involves supernatural forces, that his enemy works for an entity that defies natural law, hasn't fully penetrated his rational prospector's mindset.

But the evidence keeps accumulating, and eventually, Jack will have to confront a truth more disturbing than simple human betrayal: that the world has changed since Gettysburg, that impossible things have become possible, and that his quest for revenge has placed him at the center of conflicts far stranger and more dangerous than a dispute between former partners.

For now, Jack does his job, gathers information, and waits for the day when he'll face Randy Robinson again. When that day comes, there will be a reckoning—one way or another, Jack will have his due.

And if Randy's tied up with supernatural forces? Well, Jack's already dug himself out from under a collapsed mine with his bare hands. Whatever else comes, he'll deal with it the same way he's dealt with forty years of frontier hardship: by being too stubborn to quit and too mean to die easy.
