## Character 1: Mexicali Bob - NO CHANGES

**Current XP:** 120 spent, 130 total
**Status:** ✅ This is our baseline - no changes needed

**Rationale:** Mexicali Bob is already at the target level with a well-balanced build.

---

## Character 2: Cornelius Wilberforce III

### Current State
- **XP:** 182 spent (62 over target)
- **Skills:** 47 (excessive!)
- **Background:** Railroad executive, son of Vanderbilt, educated scholar

### Problem Analysis
1. **Too many d12 skills** - 12 skills at maximum level
2. **Redundant perception skills** - Artillery, Arts, Scrutinize, Search, Trackin' all at d10+
3. **Skills outside his role** - Bow, Mad Science (that's Doc's specialty)
4. **Over-diversified** - He's good at everything, which dilutes his identity

### Proposed Changes

**REMOVE These Skills (19 skills removed):**
- `Artillery d10` - Not his role (military/combat specialist)
- `Arts d10` - Not essential to railroad executive
- `Scrutinize d10` - Redundant with Search
- `Trackin' d10` - Not his expertise (he's city-bred)
- `Bow d10` - Not his weapon style
- `Sleight o' Hand d10` - Not essential
- `Mad Science d10` - That's Doc Emett's specialty
- `Animal Wranglin' d10` - Not relevant to railroad exec
- `Overawe d8` - Keep Persuasion instead (he's not intimidating)
- `Performin' d8` - Not his focus
- `Tale Tellin' d10` - Not essential
- `Climbin' d6` - Not important for his role
- `Drivin' d6` - Not needed

**REDUCE These Skills (keep but lower):**
- `Survival d12 → d6` - He's educated and city-bred, not a frontiersman
- `Tinkerin' d12 → d8` - Good with machines but not master (save d12 for core skills)
- `Scroungin' d12 → d6` - Wealthy railroad exec doesn't scrounge
- `Demolition d12 → d8` - Railroad work skill, but not his specialty
- `Search d10 → d6` - Basic competency
- `Area Knowledge d10 → d8` - Good but not exceptional
- `Language d8 → d6` - Educated but not linguist
- `Disguise d12 → d10` - Still excellent (fits desperate need for approval)
- `Streetwise d12 → d10` - Still very good

**KEEP These Skills (core identity):**
- `Professional d12` - His expertise (business/railroad)
- `Science d12` - Educated scholar

- **XP:** 94 spent (26 under target)
- **Skills:** 31 skills
- **Edges:** Only 2!
- **Background:** 40-year-old prospector, betrayed by brother, tough old geezer, geologist

### Problem Analysis
1. **Underleveled** - Needs +23 XP
2. **Only 2 edges** - Should have more for a 120 XP character
3. **Missing prospecting flavor** - Has Professional d12 and Mining d12 but low survival skills

- Low attributes (Smarts d4, Spirit d4, Vigor d4) - that's his character

**Result:** 31 skills (same count, improved values), 5 edges (was 2), 117 XP spent

**Character Identity Enhanced:**
- Now actually has prospector/survival skills
- "Tough as Nails" fits the limping tough old man

## Summary of Rationale

### Why These Changes?

**Overleveled Characters (Cornelius, Doc, John Henry):**
- **Problem:** Too many skills at d12, excessive skill counts, redundant abilities
- **Solution:** Remove skills outside core identity, reduce redundant skills, focus each character
- **Preserved:** Core competencies, combat effectiveness, character essence

**Underleveled Character (Jack Horner):**
- **Problem:** Only 2 edges, missing essential survival skills for a prospector
- **Solution:** Add thematic edges, improve prospecting/survival skills
- **Preserved:** Low attributes (geezer), high Agility combat skills

**Incomplete Characters (Lucas, George):**
- **Lucas:** Built as Agency Marshall gunslinger (matches existing edges)
- **George:** Created as professional gambler (fills party role gap)

### Character Diversity After Balancing

1. **Mexicali Bob** - Apprentice Shaman (magic/spirits)
2. **Cornelius** - Railroad Executive (business/leadership)
3. **Doc Emett** - Mad Scientist (inventions/explosives)
4. **John Henry** - Harrowed Hexslinger (supernatural/healing)
5. **Jack Horner** - Prospector/Geologist (mining/survival)
6. **Lucas Turner** - Agency Marshall (law/gunfighting)
7. **George C Dobbs** - Professional Gambler (social/con artist)

**Each character has a distinct role with no overlap!**
