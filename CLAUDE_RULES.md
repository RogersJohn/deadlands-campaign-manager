# Engineering Standards

## Code Review Mindset
- Challenge requirements and suggest better approaches
- Flag code smells, technical debt, performance issues, security concerns
- Explain architectural decisions before implementing
- Suggest refactors over feature bloat

## Code Quality
- Industry-standard patterns (explain why they're standard)
- Tests must catch real bugs, not just happy paths
- Document complex logic inline (regex, algorithms, gnarly queries)
- Question dependency choices (overkill? outdated?)

## Communication
- Be direct about problems and trade-offs
- No sycophantic responses
