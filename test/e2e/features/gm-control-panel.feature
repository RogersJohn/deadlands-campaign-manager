Feature: GM Control Panel
  As a Game Master
  I want a dedicated control panel to manage game state
  So that I can change maps and reset the game efficiently

  Background:
    Given the application is running
    And test accounts exist:
      | username    | password  | role         |
      | e2e_testgm  | Test123!  | GAME_MASTER  |
      | e2e_player1 | Test123!  | PLAYER       |
      | e2e_player2 | Test123!  | PLAYER       |
    And characters exist for all players

  @critical @gm-panel @visibility
  Scenario: GM Control Panel is only visible to Game Master
    # Player should NOT see the panel
    Given "e2e_player1" is logged in as Player in browser "Player1"
    When "Player1" enters the game arena
    Then "Player1" should not see the GM Control Panel

    # GM should see the panel
    Given "e2e_testgm" is logged in as Game Master in browser "GM"
    When "GM" enters the game arena
    Then "GM" should see the GM Control Panel
    And the panel should display current game state information

  @gm-panel @game-state-display
  Scenario: GM Control Panel displays current game state
    Given "e2e_testgm" is logged in as Game Master in browser "GM"
    And "e2e_player1" is logged in as Player in browser "Player1"
    And both are in the game arena

    Then the GM panel should show:
      | Field       | Value               |
      | Map         | No map set or valid map name |
      | Turn        | 1                   |
      | Tokens      | 0 on map            |

    When "e2e_player1" moves their token to position (100, 100)
    And "GM" waits for panel to update
    Then the GM panel should show "1" token on the map

  @critical @gm-panel @map-change
  Scenario: GM can change the map and clear all tokens
    Given "e2e_testgm" is logged in as Game Master in browser "GM"
    And "e2e_player1" is logged in as Player in browser "Player1"
    And "e2e_player2" is logged in as Player in browser "Player2"
    And all players are in the game arena

    # Players place tokens
    When "e2e_player1" moves their token to position (110, 95)
    And "e2e_player2" moves their token to position (105, 100)
    Then the GM panel should show "2" tokens on the map

    # GM changes map
    When "GM" opens the GM Control Panel
    And "GM" clicks "Change Map"
    And "GM" enters map name "desert_canyon"
    And "GM" confirms the map change
    Then "GM" should see a notification "Map changed to: desert_canyon"
    And "GM" should see a notification "All tokens cleared"
    And the GM panel should show map "desert_canyon"
    And the GM panel should show "0" tokens on the map

    # Players' tokens should be cleared
    When "Player1" refreshes and returns to arena
    Then "Player1" should not see any tokens on the map

    When "e2e_player1" moves their token to position (100, 100)
    And "e2e_player2" moves their token to position (120, 120)
    Then the GM panel should show "2" tokens on the map

    # Player 2 goes offline (closes browser)
    When "Player2" closes their browser

    # GM changes map while Player 2 is offline
    And "GM" changes the map to "saloon_interior"
    Then the GM panel should show map "saloon_interior"
    And the GM panel should show "0" tokens on the map
    And the database should contain 0 token positions

    # Player 2 comes back online
    When "e2e_player2" logs in again in browser "Player2"
