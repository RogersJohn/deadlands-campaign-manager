There Will Come a Reckoning

Like the High Plains drifters of old, some folks have to walk alone. That's you, Marshal. This book is full of dark secrets and dirty tricks fit only for a Marshal's eyes.
If you've been paying attention--and you've read the Player's Guide, which is recommended--you might have figured out that things started going wrong with a capital W around 1863. That's both true and false. The fact is that supernatural evil has been around a whole lot longer.

The Order of Things
Since man has walked the Earth, there have been monsters hiding in the shadows. All cultures have their bogeymen, their spooks, and mons ters that frighten children and adults alike. Collectively, they're called "abomin a tions," and they are very real.
Abominations dwell in the physical world. In the spirit world--the Indians call them the Hunting Grounds, and so do we--nature spirits and manitous are more common. Nature spirits are generally good or at least neutral toward the affairs of man. Manitous are downright evil.
Manitous drain fear and other negative emotions the abominations spawn, and channel them back to a special place in the Hunting Grounds called the Deadlands. There, incredibly powerful and evil spirits--basically the head manitous in charge--dwell, and feast upon the heaped helpings of

fear delivered by the manitous. At the moment, the most powerful of these spirits are the Reckoners, and all the others are forced to make do with scraps from their spiritual table.
The manitous don't know much about their mysterious masters, only that the Reckoners horde the fear they deliver to the Deadlands. Most of the fear is consumed by the Reckoners or set aside for some unholy purpose, but some small sparks are granted to the manitous. The manitous then use these seeds to create more abominations according to the Reckoners' whims, and the abominations, in turn, create more fear to feed the Reckoners.
It's an ongoing, vicious circle with razor-sharp teeth, and it's been going on since the dawn of time. The Reckoners aren't the only beings to prey on humanity in this fashion, but once they took control of the Deadlands they got it down to an art form. It didn't take long for things to get out of hand. Whole societies lived in fear, feeding the Reckoners' unholy appetites. The future

1
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
was looking pretty grim for the human race, right up until the end of the Middle Ages.
Who Are the Reckoners?
The Reckoners are not the first evil gods of the Hunting Grounds. Indeed, the Deadlands are ruled by a hierarchy of evil spirits--the Reckoners just happen to be the most powerful at the moment. They were once relatively minor powers in the Deadlands, but they hitched their evil little wagons to a movement called Christianity a couple thousand years ago.
As the new religion gained momentum, the Reckoners remade themselves as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. This allowed them to focus the fear of millions of people on a fairly small cadre

of evil entities, where previously folks' fear went to feed a rogues' gallery of malicious gods.
Though not everyone believes Christian doctrine, the Reckoners ulti mately became powerful enough to muscle out the rest of their dark com patriots. They now have first crack at any fear the manitous deliver, whether it comes from Christians, Muslims, Jews, or anyone else.
The Old Ones
That's when the Old Ones--the elder medicine men of the various Indian tribes in the American East--called a council deep in the mountains of New England. There, they discussed the state of the Earth and the increasing number

2
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

of horrors that walked upon their sacred lands.
The Old Ones knew there was no way to banish all evil from the land at once. The abominations would have to be faced by the valiant, and defeated one at a time. If the manitous were gone, however, it would ensure far fewer new abominations would be born.
The Great Spirit War
The Old Ones asked the spirits of nature to war against their evil cousins, the manitous. The spirits agreed, but their price was high. The Old Ones would have to join them in their war.
The Old Ones traveled to an ancient Micmac burial ground and began a long and arduous ritual. When they were finished, a portal to the Hunting Grounds stood open.
The shamans stepped through and began their long campaign against the manitous. The Great Spirit War raged for hundreds of years as time is measured in the Hunting Grounds, though no one really knows how much time passed in the physical world. It was a secret battle unseen by the vast majority of mankind. Only the most spiritually powerful individuals sensed something was afoot.
The Old Ones finally tracked down and defeated their foes, but the manitous, being spirits, could not truly be destroyed. The best the Old Ones could do was defeat them and hold them to a sacred bond: as long as the Old Ones and the nature spirits remained in the Hunting Grounds, the manitous could not escape either. No spirit, good or evil, could interfere with the affairs of men any longer. The Old Ones were trapped with the malignant spirits they

There Will Come a Reckoning
had defeated, but the horrors of the world abated and began to dwindle. The price the shamans paid was high, but the Great Spirit War was won.
A Tale of Vengeance
The manitous kept their bargain. For hundreds of years, no new abominations were born, and those supernatural horrors that remained on Earth slowly dwindled and died.
Then, in 1763, a young Indian shaman of the Susquehanna tribe was just completing his studies. He was an incredible student, who devoured every arcane lesson of his elders as if it were his last meal. Though the spirits could no longer visit the Earth, shamans and other mystically powerful souls could communicate with them on their home turf, the Hunting Grounds. Raven listened eagerly to their words.
One summer day, he sat on a high mountain in the new colony the white men called Virginia. As he meditated, the nature spirits told him of the Great Spirit War, and the pact the Old Ones had made with the manitous. His conversation was cut short by the sound of musket fire near his village far below.
Raven descended the mountain as fast as he could, the cruel din of battle mocking his every step. His feet felt as if they were made of stone, and miles seemed like leagues. When he finally arrived at his village, he saw a band of white men butchering his family. They were the last of the Susquehanna, and now Raven was the last son of a dead tribe.

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Raven Reborn
Raven stayed hidden, and watched the massacre of every human being he held dear. His heart filled with hatred, he left the valley that was once his home and wandered the Earth, searching for ways to increase his own power and exact revenge on the white men.
The shaman learned many secrets during his travels among both the Indian tribes and the towns of the white men. He also learned rituals that enabled him to sustain his own life. Though born in 1745, Raven looks no more than 40 years old today. The most important secret he learned, however, was that the Old Ones had left their long forgotten door to the Hunting Grounds wide open.
From 1861 to 1863, Raven visited all the tribes he could, and spoke solemnly of the massacre of his people. He said he

was the last of his tribe, the Last Son of the Susquehanna, and he was searching for other braves who shared his thirst for vengeance.
Other shamans often sensed Raven's long quest for revenge had twisted him, and that he was consumed by evil. Most banished him quickly. Sometimes, though, a vengeful youth--often an adopted survivor of a massacred tribe-- turned his back on his adopted family to follow Raven on his dark quest.
These young men understood Raven's sorrow and rage. They were the last of their tribes, villages, and families as well. Like Raven, they were the Last Sons.
The Last Sons
Raven told his followers their troubles were caused by the coming of the white men. In some cases, this

4
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

There Will Come a Reckoning

was true. In others, it was yet another gross misunderstanding between two different cultures.
In either case, Raven told the Last Sons he knew how to defeat their common enemy. The Last Sons would release the manitous from their pact, and there would come a Reckoning.
Raven told the braves and shamans who chose to follow him that the mani tous were the tribes' protection against the white man's expanding invasion. He said the Old Ones were fools for banishing the spirits. By forbidding the manitous from leaving the Hunting Grounds, they had limited their own powers and condemned the tribes to a long and painful road that could only end in their destruction.

According to Raven, it was the Last Sons' sacred duty to travel to the Hunting Grounds and return the spirit world to its natural order. There was only one way to accomplish this--they would enter the Hunting Grounds and murder the Old Ones.
The Hunt
The Last Sons began their long trek to the wooded mountains of New England early in 1863. The group reached the old Micmac burial ground on the first day of July, and stepped through the Old Ones' gate into the Hunting Grounds.
Only a few days passed in the physical world, but the Last Sons' battle with the Old Ones took many weeks in the

5
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

Hunting Grounds. In that strange place, the Last Sons committed one atrocity after another, and hunted and slew the Old Ones in the name of vengeance.
The remaining Last Sons emerged from the Hunting Grounds on July 3, 1863, their war complete. It was only a few hours before America's Day of Independence, and the Battle of Gettysburg was in full swing.
Many of the Last Sons did not return, but their quest was successful. The Old Ones were dead, and their blackened spirit blood forever stained the hands of their slayers. The manitous were free once more.
The Reckoning had begun.

The Reckoning
When the manitous were bound in the Hunting Grounds, they could no longer deliver tasty tidbits of fear to the Deadlands. The Reckoners slumbered. As the last of the Old Ones died, the pact was broken. The manitous immediately gathered up as much fear as they could, and the Reckoners stirred to find a feast before them. The Reckoners reveled in their revival, but remained all too aware of the mistakes of their past.
The Reckoners now know they cannot flood the world with abominations. An army of monstrous creatures would expend all of the Reckoners' precious

6
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

energy. Worse, jaded mortals stop fearing the creatures of the night and fight back, as the Old Ones did centuries ago. Far more energy can be generated by keeping the abominations at the edge of the unknown and relying more upon purely human evil.
Mortals bleed pure terror. When the Earth is flooded with enough fear to sustain the Reckoners, when it is finally remade in the image of the Deadlands, the Reckoners will walk upon it.
The World Today
Now it's 1879, and the Reckoners' plans are going nicely. Though a ceasefire has stalled the War Between the States, the Great Rail Wars are once more picking up steam. The Indians fight against the white men and each other, some abandoning the Old Ways and some forsaking the nature spirits. The dead rise from their graves and strange beasts stalk the terrain.
Though the Reckoners' plots encom pass the whole of the Earth, the American West is the focus of their efforts. The wide open spaces give their creations plenty of room to hide, and the lawless frontier pits man against man on a daily basis. Before we get into the

There Will Come a Reckoning
details of what's going on in the Weird West--including the state of the Great Rail Wars--let's talk a bit about fear.
The Power of Fear
Fear is the bread and butter of the Reckoners, and all of their effort goes into cooking up a simmering stewpot of the nasty stuff. See, fear is like candy to the Reckoners, only a lot more nutritious. They thrive on the energy produced when a cowpoke screams for mama and soils his delicates.
Even without the influence of the Reckoners, there's already plenty to be afraid of in the Weird West. Spies and saboteurs are at work in the Union and Confederacy, and they're thick on the ground in the Disputed Territories. The Rail Barons' forces prey on each other, and don't much care about the innocents caught in the crossfire. In many cases, folks can't even count on the law to do right out West. All the while, the manitous work to make things even worse, slowly "terrorforming" the environment to make it more hospitable to the Reckoners.

7
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Terrorforming
The manitous and the Reckoners are busting their evil butts to make the West an even more fearful place than it already is. The Reckoners cannot yet influence earthly events on a massive scale, though they are capable of communicating with a few of their most powerful servants. The manitous do the lion's share of the work by birthing horrific abominations.
These abominations can take any of a million different shapes, based on the whim of the manitous that create them. Usually, they give life to dark legends of the local populace, whether Indian or white. Some manitous might invest a bit of energy in raising a pack of walkin' dead to terrorize the locals, while another might dust off an ancient Indian myth and set it loose on the prairie.

In any case, the biggest baddest thing in a given area is responsible for raising the Fear Level. We call it a "fearmonger." It calls the heroes "lunch." This is often the main creature or creatures behind your tale of terror in a particular session or series of sessions, Marshal. This is the creature that best serves the Reckoners, and creates the most terror in an area.
Fearmongers might have minions, but they have no real control over other abominations or villains. In fact, the monsters of the Reckoning almost always work alone. Several powerful abominations may all exist in one area, but only the wickedest is the fearmonger.
A given fearmonger rules over a particular location, such as a forest, a cave, a haunted mine, a town where folks have been disappearing, and so forth. However, this territory isn't necessarily

8
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

There Will Come a Reckoning

a geographic area: a manitou might inhabit an artifact, or haunt an Indian tribe with a powerful curse.
Fearmongers can raise a Fear Level by +1 every month or so, assuming they cause considerable mischief and don't go overboard. That's a very rough guideline, Marshal. Some critters are far more subtle, taking years to work their dark magic. Others barge in and start rending, driving the Fear Level up in a week.
Abominations that get too wild can actually stagnate a Fear Level, since the unknown is the greatest horror of all. A mysterious horror that stalks the Maze leaving slaughtered prospectors in its wake strikes fear into everyone. A band of bloodthirsty banditos--even bloodthirsty undead ones--are just another foe to waste bullets on.

Speaking of things to waste bullets on, let's talk a little about the different kinds of horrors your heroes might face.
Abominations
Abominations are your run-of-the-mill horrors (though don't tell your posse we said that). Walkin' dead, wall crawlers, and hangin' judges are all good (okay, evil) examples.
As a rule, such creatures are concerned only with their own survival. They know and care nothing of the Reckoners, nor of the part they play in the Reckoners' plans. That said, these abominations are no less horrific or deadly for their ignorance of their place in the big picture.
Despite their general lack of awareness, abominations are more than capable of taking on the role of Fearmonger. Sometimes, a group of abominations

9
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
might do so, like a pack of walkin' dead infesting a mine.
Many abominations are common enough that they're more or less accepted as part of the local fauna--Maze dragons, for instance--though folks back East generally dismiss them as tall tales.
Servitors
Servitors are far more insidious than abominations. Servitors are those individuals who have chosen the path of evil. That said, it is rarely presented as such, nor are Servitors often aware of their servitude. The four most powerful in the Weird West are Captain Jasper Stone, Raven, the Reverend Ezekiah Grimme, and Darius Hellstromme, who serve Death, War, Famine, and Pestilence respectively.
Each chose to commit an evil deed and start down the slippery slope of servitude, and as they each committed more atrocities, still worse sins came more easily. Stone is the first modern Harrowed, so evil that he cowed his manitou into submission and forced it to tell him of the Reckoners. He now serves as the Reckoners' attack dog, and dispatches heroes left and right. Raven's original sin is obvious, and since his victory over the Old Ones, he and his followers have committed many more atrocities against the white men. Grimme's story is a bit more involved, but ultimately resulted in him serving human flesh to starving folks in order to increase his own power and influence. Hellstromme is the world's preeminent mad scientist, and has no regard for the well-being of others. He considers people tools to be used and abused, often as test subjects.
You can create your own lesser Servitors to throw at your posse. Just remember that all Servitors were once

human (Hellstromme is an exception in that he still is), and more importantly that they chose their fate--it was not forced upon them. Trust us. It's a Faustian thing.
Over time, these monstrous individuals can become monsters in the more literal sense, and whether or not their bodies are twisted to match their blackened souls, they each develop unique powers based on their past misdeeds. It turns out that their evil past is also their Achilles heel, as most Servitors are invulnerable except for a specific weakness. Clues to this vulnerability can be found in the story of their respective falls to evil.
Note also that most of these indi vid uals are completely unaware of their servitude, and each would likely deny such with his dying breath. Only the most powerful know they serve higher, darker powers. Not even Darius Hellstromme knows of the Reckoners' existence, though he suspects much.
Manitous
These are evil spirits that knowingly serve the Reckoners. They drain the fear and negative emotions created by their horrific creations, and channel them back to the Reckoners.
Of course, the Reckoners are crafty cusses, and the manitous have instruc tions to invest a little of that fear back into sowing more abominations on Earth, thus reaping more fear. It's near impossible to attack a manitou directly. Even if they take a direct hand in events--say, by raising a posse of walkin' dead--they're really just playing with their toys.
The easiest way to get rid of a manitou is to starve 'em out by lowering the Fear Level (see page 17). A manitou can be killed, but only if it has bound itself permanently to the physical world by creating a Harrowed (see page 21). Then,

10
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

There Will Come a Reckoning

the Harrowed must be finished with a shot to the head, or exorcised of the demon within.
The Reckoners are the most powerful of these spirits, so powerful that they may not even be manitous at all. Whether that's true or not they aren't saying, but they do not directly exert their influence on Earth, instead allowing the manitous to do most of their dirty work.

Mundanes
Mundanes are ordinary folk that go around scarin' the bejeebers out of other folk. Whether murderous Indians, warmongering army officers, or a psychotic serial killer, mundanes can be just as dangerous--and just as fearsome--as the worst the Reckoners have to offer.

11
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
The Reckoners and manitous love these guys. All of the benefits of an abomination, no investment required.
Fear Levels
We've talked a lot about fear so far, Marshal--how important it is to the Reckoners and how widespread it is in the Weird West. As you read on through the rest of this book, you'll find that each area your posse visits has its own "Fear Level," to represent the success of the Reckoners and their minions in turning the world into a living Hell. In the next chapter, you'll find the rules for using Fear Levels in your game.
Now that we know how things get scary, let's talk a little about what each Fear Level should look and feel like.
Fear Level 0
This is happy land, folks. The natives are friendly, the sky is blue, and you can walk the streets at night. Perhaps you won't be surprised to hear that only a few of these places are left in the Weird West, and they ain't easy to find.
Fear Level 1
In such places, some folks believe monsters exist, they just haven't seen any. The sky is still blue, but if you must go out at night, bring a buddy.
Fear Level 2
No one goes near the creepy old shack on top of the hill. The land looks about the same, but the shadows are just a little bit longer. It's not really safe to go out alone at night, but it's not a death sentence, either. This is the prevailing Fear Level in most places these days.

Fear Level 3
Things are starting to get a little weird. There's an occasional disappearance, and probably more than a few weird creatures live close by (though folks don't really talk about it). Don't go out at night without a weapon or a friend.
Fear Level 4
There are mysterious disappearances, and when the bodies are found, it's piece by piece. The land itself starts to change: the shadows on the cliffs start to look like leering faces, or cornrows always seem to rustle as if something's hiding within. The winds of the High Plains might whisper your name.
Fear Level 5
There's no doubt something's amiss. Folks have seen monsters, and almost everyone's terrified. Most flowers die, but weeds have no problem thriving. Don't go out at night without an armed posse.
Fear Level 6 (Deadland)
This is as bad as it gets, Marshal--a fullblown nightmare landscape. Monsters run rampant, rocks look like skulls, and not only do the wailing winds of the High Plains whisper your name, they do so in your dead friend's voice.
Anyone out at night is dead meat. If the Reckoners have their way, the entire planet is destined to one day become such a fearsome place.
The Prospector
With all this talk of fear, Marshal, there's one character we ought to mention who may actually help your

12
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

There Will Come a Reckoning

players out. He's a little crazy, but he has a lot of information about the material in this chapter.
Coot Jenkins is a grizzled old pro spector who met up with one of Raven's Last Sons long ago, shortly after the Reckoning began. You'd kinda figure an angry native might up and scalp old Coot, but this one did something different: he confessed. See, by this time, the Last Son was dying, and guilt for what he'd done was eating away at him.
Coot was a bit skeptical at first, but as horrific changes began taking place across America, he began to believe. Further, he began to run across some folks who, though they were undead horrors, seemed right decent to him. Yep, you guessed it--these folks were Harrowed.

Over time, Coot figured out most of the truth about Harrowed folks, and he learned a whole lot about the Reckoning and the Reckoners themselves as well. And he decided to do something about it. Deuced cuss that he is, he might just succeed. See, he's been gathering an army--an army of the dead.
A while back, Coot discovered an elixir that, when poured down a Harrowed's gullet, puts the mortal soul squarely in control of his mortal remains once more. Coot's been traveling the Weird West and digging Harrowed folks up, "curing" them of their afflictions. He knows the elixir doesn't hold forever, but he figures he knows enough about the Harrowed to realize when one of them's losing it. He also found out about the Old Ones and their sacrifice to shut the Reckoners out of our world centuries ago. He figures

13
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
that if another band of folks takes their place in the Hunting Grounds, the pact can be repaired. Who better than the Harrowed?
Trouble is, he knows full well that if even one manitou gains control it'll break the deal and his plans will only stall the Reckoners, rather than shut them out for good. He's looking for a solution a bit more permanent than his old elixir, but so far has come up empty. Unfortunately, he's wrong--the only way for a manitou to permanently lose control of a Harrowed host is for the host to be put down for good--but he can't be convinced of that.
That said, Coot is the man with the most information about one of our other

players--Stone. He tried to recruit the lone rider once and barely escaped with his life. He now knows Stone for what he is--the chosen slayer of the Reckoners.
Dark Plots
Now that we're all up to speed on the circumstances and happenings of the Reckoning, let's take a little time to sort out just what each of the Reckoners' top dogs is up to as 1879 gets rolling.
We cover the salient points of each Servitor's machinations later in this book. But that doesn't mean we can't jaw a little about the territory each of them wanders, and how their ploys fit right into the Reckoners' plans.

14
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Famine's Feast
All of California and the Great Maze are Famine's Realm, and her Servitor is the Reverend Ezekiah Grimme. As head of the Church of Lost Angels, Grimme and his 13 Elders (or Ghouls, depending on who you talk to) are charged with keeping the status quo of crippling fear, near-starvation, and false piety. In the meanwhile, Maze Wars rage between nations and Rail Barons alike over the plentiful deposits of ghost rock found there.
Incidentally, Grimme's town full of fanatics also serves as the ultimate goal of all the Rail Barons. As 1879 progresses, the competitors speed toward the Great Maze, each Hell-bent on winning the prize.
War Is Hell
The High Plains, the Sioux Nations, the Coyote Confederation, and the Disputed Territories of Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma wedged between them--all these are War's lands, and this is where War's errand boy Raven does most of his grisly work. He and his Last Sons are busy maneuvering the Indians into conflicts that are as likely to destroy the tribes themselves as they are the white man.

There Will Come a Reckoning
Wages of Death
By far the most feared of the Servitors, Stone typically wanders the vast portion of the Weird West claimed by Death--Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada (plus Death Valley in California, naturally). That doesn't mean he's limited to that area, though. In fact he wanders far and wide, wherever his neverending mission takes him. Some say Stone knows paths through the Hunting Grounds, forgotten by man and spirit alike, that allow him to visit other worlds...and even other times.
Pestilential Treatment
At first glance one might be tempted to assume Pestilence isn't too high on the Reckoners' totem pole, seeing as the Reckoner really only lays claim to one piece of land: the nation of Deseret, formerly known at Utah. That'd be a serious error in judgment, amigo.
Pestilence could very well be the most influential of the Reckoners, and his Servitor the most famous. Dr. Darius Hellstromme, through his many scientific advancements and industrial efforts, has helped spread the twin "diseases" of ghost rock and technology across North America, and even to other parts of the world.
But Hellstromme is still human, which renders his true goals and desires as opaque as the depths of the human heart. It's said his experiments with Fear are not mere research, but steps along a twisted trail to something far more terrible. Time will tell...

More Setting Rules

Howdy, Marshal. The rules in this chapter are primarily for you to use to torment and terrify your friends in the posse. Most of them build upon the Setting Rules presented in the Player's Guide. We only give the players enough rope to hang themselves. You get the rest, Marshal.
In addition, though, we'll discuss how the heroes can actually fight the Reckoners and attempt to take back the Weird West from the horrors running roughshod over it.

So, how do you take what you now know about the Weird West and put it into the game? Read on and find out. This chapter contains rules for a lot of the stuff you've just been reading about, collected in one spot to make it easy to find in the heat of battle. So if you ever need to check what happens to a Harrowed who's lost control, or to a huckster who fumbles his hex, this is the place to come. We'll start with the lowdown on Fear.
Fear Levels
As we mentioned earlier, an area's Fear Level--a measure of how scared the local populace is--actually reflects on the terrain. This, in turn, inflicts a penalty to all Guts checks equal to the local Fear Level. Each region of the Weird West has an overall Fear Level, as explained in the next chapter. This can vary a great deal in specific locations, but unless noted otherwise, assume that any locations within a geographic area share the general Fear Level.

Descriptions of what particular levels of Fear look and feel like are on page 12, to help you set the scene for your players.
Lowering the Fear Level
The best way for your intrepid heroes to fight evil is to fight the fear that sustains the Reckoners.
Once the posse defeats a major evil, one of the heroes may make a Persuasion roll to tell the tale of the group's victory over the forces of darkness. The epic needs to be recounted to a sizable audience (or an influential one, like the local reporter), and should always be accompanied by an actual recounting by the player. It must also be told within the area affected--an audience in New York doesn't care so much what happens in Podunk, Iowa.
Don't penalize a player if he's not actually a good storyteller--that's his character's job--but do make him try. In any case, the Persuasion roll is modified by the Fear Level and any other situational modifier you think is appropriate (his audience doesn't like

17
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

him, most don't speak English, etc). And you can certainly give him a bonus of +1 or +2 if he tells a really good tale.
If the tale teller is ultimately successful, he reduces the local Fear Level by 1. If he rolls a 1 on his Persuasion die (regardless of the result of the Wild Die), he sent the wrong message and did little more than reinforce the notion that people should be afraid of the dark--he actually increases the Fear Level by +1!
Legend Chips
Whenever the posse successfully lowers the Fear Level of an area, they get a shiny new "Legend chip." This is a special, one-time-only award, and it goes right into the Fate Pot.
Don't hand it out to a specific player-- Fate decides who she smiles on when

the players draw their chips before each session. If you draw a Legend chip, put it back and draw again until you get a different one. Legend chips are only for the heroes, Marshal.
Once a player draws and uses the Legend chip, it is removed from play until they earn another one. It doesn't go into the pot at the start of the next session once it has been used.
Tables o' Doom
The rest of this chapter gives you all the mean-spirited tables and snippets we only hint at in the Player's Guide, from the infamous Veteran o' the Weird West table to what happens when a mad scientist picks a new power. We round it out with more details about including Harrowed heroes in your game, and how to deal with them.

18
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Mad Science and Other Insanity
As you may have sussed from the rumor and innuendo in the Deadlands Player's Guide, Marshal, most inventions of the new science are the result of manitous "inspiring" mad scientists. Though most scientists don't know it or won't believe it, these evil spirits whisper in their ears while they sleep, in many cases suggesting designs that would not work at all were it not for the supernatural properties of ghost rock.
That's right, despite what "rational" scientists think, ghost rock is not a natural ore. It was deposited here by the Reckoners back in '63, and it has wreaked havoc ever since. The real reason it's so powerful is that it's made of exactly what those gloomy naysayers claim--the souls of the damned.
You see, when bad folks die, they don't go to Hell. Assuming the Reckoners don't resurrect them as abominations, the worst souls go to the Hunting Grounds where they become manitous (and no matter how much fun it seems like they're having, that's a pretty rotten existence).
The weakest of the manitous are made into ghost rock by the Reckoners, then returned to Earth. Now most of these spirits were pretty bad men in life and they were promised a little fun in the hereafter, by the mischievous manitous that encouraged their evil deeds. To find they have been duped by evil spirits and forced into a chunk of ghost rock for all eternity is a rude awakening for them, and they learn pretty quick how insignificant they are in the cosmic scheme. That's why ghost rock shrieks when it burns--the sound is actually the damned souls screaming in pain and frustration.

More Setting Rules
Veteran o' the Weird West
This is the table for those powerhungry munchkins who bit off more than they can chew.
Don't forget to cackle with glee when you read the result, Marshal. In some cases, though, you may want to keep the actual result secret until the time is right to reveal it to the player.
Deuce: Jinxed
This hombre ran into something that jinxed him bad. He gains the Bad Luck Hindrance. If he had it already, he lucks out (he doesn't get it again).
Three: Hunted
The veteran didn't finish the job. Something is looking for him, and it wants him dead. Or worse.
The Marshal gets to whip up some nasty beastie to come looking for the poor bastard. It's something fairly powerful, certainly a Wild Card, and perhaps more clever than strong. It might look to make the hero's life a living Hell instead of just springing out of the darkness one night.
Four: Debt
The Agency (red card) or Texas Rangers (black card) has something on the hero that could make him swing if it were revealed to the general public. They frequently recruit him for the roughest assign ments, and "no" isn't really an option. When they come knocking, these organizations don't ask nicely, or twice.

...continued
Five: Addicted
The character would like to forget the things he's seen. He has a Major Habit for alcohol or a drug like opium or peyote.
Six: Night Terrors
The cowpoke can never forget the horrors he's experienced. They even haunt him in his dreams, giving him the Bad Dreams Hindrance.
Seven: Maimed
An encounter with some supernatural creature left one of the character's limbs maimed or entirely missing. Roll a d6. On a 1­3, he's Lame; on a 4­6, he lost his non-weapon hand and has the One Arm Hindrance.
Eight: Beat With an Ugly Stick
One of the abominations this unfor tunate hero encountered rearranged the hero's face or some other visible body part. He's Ugly when the wound is visible.
Nine: Insane
This dude's mind isn't what it once was. Roll once on the mad scientist's Dementia Table on page 20.
Ten: Paranoid
This tinhorn's seen things he shouldn't have. He's afraid of the dark, afraid to wander out of camp to relieve himself, and so on. He's so jumpy that all his Guts rolls are modified by ­2.
Jack: Infected
The last creature this hombre tussled with left a mark that won't go away. The hero has some sort of wound that gives him the Ailin' (Major) Hindrance.

Queen: Bollixed
This gunfighter has a bad case of gremlins. These buggers infect every device the hero touches, including guns and other non-Weird Science mechanical devices. Any time the hero rolls a 1 on his trait die (regardless of his Wild Die) when using a mechanical device, it suffers a malfunction and is unusable until someone spends 2d6 hours working on it and makes a successful Repair roll.
True infernal devices (which are already prone to mishap) malfunction on a skill roll of 1 or 2!
King: Marked For Death
Some intelligent and phenomenally evil abomination from the hero's past uttered a dying curse. All of the hero's Soak rolls are made at ­2.
Ace: Forsaken
Long ago, this lone rider did some thing awful to survive an encounter with the supernatural. Ever since, the spirit world won't aid him on a bet. No beneficial tribal medicine or miracles work on him. Hexes, weird science, and black magic work normally. Lucky stiff.
Black Joker: Cursed
The hero's very soul was damned by one of the insidious creatures of his terror-filled past. The player draws only one Fate Chip at the beginning of each play session, or none if he has the Bad Luck Hindrance.
Red Joker: Harrowed
This gunhand took a dirt nap some time in the recent past. Difference between him and most folks, though, is that he got up again. The hero begins play Harrowed (using the information found in the Player's Guide), but he doesn't know it. Don't let the deader take his first Harrowed Edge until he discovers the grisly truth.

Constant exposure to these tortured spirits would drive anyone a little bit nuts. Since genius is the next closest thing to insanity, and mad scientists are around the stuff all the time anyway, madness is all too common. Couple that with manitous whispering to them in their sleep and it's a wonder they're as sane as they are.
Mad scientists gain a dementia any time they take the New Power Edge.
Huckster Backfire
As explained earlier, hucksters draw the energy to power their hexes from manitous in the hunting grounds by engaging the spirits in a battle of wits. The hucksters tend to see these spiritual duels in terms of poker games, and when they lose a hand, their hexes often go awry. For details on when to roll on this table, check out the rules for hucksters in No Man's Land (see the Deadlands Player's Guide).
Anytime a manitou gets to run amok, it means bad news for the folks in the real world and hex backfire is no different.
The Harrowed
You may have noticed that the Deadlands Player's Guide doesn't have much on how to play a Harrowed. There's no "Harrowed" Edge that an eager player can scoop up if he wants to play one of these undead hombres. That's because Harrowed aren't made, they're born. Well, reborn, anyway.
Manitous don't go around blithely reanimating folks, especially heroes with hearts of gold. No, it takes something special for a body to get a manitou's attention. Specifically, manitous are only interested in those folks who can help generate more fear. Considering the original soul is liable to be in charge a

Brain Drain: The manitou fries part of the huckster's mind with energy from the Hunting Grounds. He's Shaken for 1d6 rounds before he can attempt to recover, and his Spellcasting drops a die type for 24 hours.
Backlash: The manitou overloads the huckster's nervous system with eldritch energy. He suffers 3d6 damage.
Spirit Sap: The hexslinger must make a Vigor roll or become Incapacitated. Even with success he suffers a level of Fatigue. One level of Fatigue is recovered every 15 minutes of rest.
Madness: The manitou drives the huckster insane. He picks up a Dementia from the Mad Scientist's Dementia Table. He must also make a Smarts roll. If failed, the Dementia is permanent. Otherwise it lasts for 1d6 days before he "snaps out of it."
Corruption: The hex is twisted to have the worst possible result for the hexslinger. Damagecausing spells affect him or his allies, protection affects his foes, informationgathering incantations lie, and so on.
Mindwipe: The manitou fries a part of the huckster's mind. The spellslinger's Spellcasting die drops 1 level permanently.

Effect
Absent Minded: The character tends to forget little details. He might eat raw coffee one day or forget to wear his pants the next. To remember an important detail, he must make a Smarts roll. If he fails, he can't remember it. Don't overuse this, Marshal, just when it is important.
Delusion: The inventor's mind snaps and he comes to believe something that is patently untrue. Maybe he thinks he's a werewolf, or the sky is blue because the "Moon People" paint it that way every morning. This quirk reduces his Charisma by 1.
Eccentricity: This cowpoke becomes what we like to call an eccentric. Other folks just call him "loco." Maybe he smothers his food in vinegar or eats lots of bran to keep his digestive system clear (ugh). The condition is basically harmless and amusing, though occasionally annoying, lowering his Charisma by 1.
Evil Deeds: An insidious manitou convinces the hero that someone or something is evil, and must be stopped. Each time the character gets this result, his madness is more pronounced. At first he may only talk badly about his "enemies." Later on he might attempt to ruin or even kill them.
Depression: The tortured genius becomes incredibly depressed about himself, his inventions, the futility of humanity, or his chances of surviving another adventure. He often speaks of mankind's impending doom. His lack of faith causes him to lose 1 point of Grit every time he gets this result.
Phobia: The scientist develops a strange fear of something completely irrational and unrelated to his inventions (his phobia does not prevent him from working). He gains a Major Phobia when in the presence of the feared object or environment. See Savage Worlds for a complete description of phobias and their effects.
Mumbler: The engineer talks to himself constantly and his sentences often taper off into meaningless drivel. Occasionally, he might hear "voices" talking back, whispering the secrets to brilliant new inventions. The frightening truth is, the voices are real. This lowers his Charisma by 1.
Paranoia: Everyone's out to steal the inventor's ideas, or so he believes. Or maybe sinister creatures from "Dimension X" are lurking just outside his lab, waiting to steal his amazing breakthrough so they can conquer the Earth. His bizarre claims lower his Charisma by 2.
Schizophrenia: Any time any player draws a Joker, the character adopts a drastically different attitude. At one moment he might be passive and restrained. Later on he's a raving madman. Choose a new Minor Hindrance for the poor sap to reflect the change. Make sure the Hindrance is a mental instability rather than a physical handicap.

good chunk of the time, it has to be a lot of fear to make up for the good the hero can do after coming back from the grave. In short, the deader has to be one hard individual for the manitou to reanimate him, and it's even better if he's famous. Nothing's more fun for a demon than ruining a shiny reputation with rape, murder, and other mayhem.
This means manitous are more likely to Harrow heroes with a colorful past. When a hero dies, shuffle up the Action Deck and deal one card per point of Grit the hero has. If a Joker comes up, the hombre's on his way back from the boneyard. Of course, crawling out of your own grave is no picnic, and when it happens, the deader suffers terrifying dreams. Read the character's Worst Nightmare description and figure out a way to turn that into a nightmare scenario based on the hero's worst fears.
Keep in mind there are a few occasions where a manitou won't animate even the hardiest of heroes. Since the demon needs to animate the brain to control the body, the corpse has to have most of its head left. Note that we said most. Both Abraham Lincoln and Wild Bill Hickok were shot in the head and they came back, but they had enough brain left for the demons to work with.
One more thing, Marshal. Manitous don't Harrow Extras because they're sent back to the Abyss when their host dies. Some might animate such folks from time to time (which is where walkin' dead come from), but they don't take up permanent residence like they do in the Harrowed.
Hitchhiker from Hell
So now that you've saddled one of your heroes with a manitou, what do you do with him? For the most part, just let the lone rider go on as he did

More Setting Rules
before he died. Manitous don't generally interfere in a hero's day-to-day life. It's just not interested in whether he orders whiskey or beer, for example. That said, if a demon sees an opportunity to spread a little fear around, it'll jump on it faster than you can say "Amen."
Just remember that a manitou won't knowingly endanger its host, because if a Harrowed dies, the manitou dies along with him.
Once the manitou decides it's time to come out and play, here's how you do it. First, you have to ante up a Fate Chip (any color). Once you've paid the piper from Hell, tell the hero to make a Spirit roll. This is (secretly) opposed by the manitou's Spirit (a manitou's Spirit is always one die type greater than the Harrowed's), and make sure the Harrowed applies his Dominion modifier to this roll. If the manitou wins, adjust the hero's Dominion as described in Beyond the Pale (in the Player's Guide). Oh, and the demon's in charge, too. The manitou keeps control for one hour. You can spend an additional Fate Chip at the end of each hour the manitou is in control to maintain its control.

23
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Playtime
Now that the manitou's in charge, just what does it do with the poor sodbuster's body? Whatever it wants, Marshal. Just remember that manitous aren't stupid; they're aware that by inhabiting the Harrowed's body, they are vulnerable to attack and they're very conscious of getting caught and killed for their misdeeds.
That in mind, a manitou's goal is chaos, mischief, and fear, but not necessarily death. They almost never make an outright attack if there is the slightest chance of being caught, instead preferring to rely on dirty tricks and subtle machinations.
That said, if one of the Harrowed's companions is in a precarious and inescapable position, most demons won't be able to resist taking advantage. Say, for example, a mad scientist friend of the Harrowed's stands looking over the edge of a deep pit full of hungry prairie ticks. No manitou on God's green earth

could resist giving the "prairie nerd" a little shove.
The Slippery Slope
Once a Harrowed starts losing Domin ion, he begins sliding down a slippery slope. For now, he may just lose control for an hour or two. However, if the Har rowed's current Dominion is at ­4, the manitou might have a chance to take permanent control.
Any time the Harrowed is Incapaci tated and "put down" (and isn't killed by a shot to the noggin) when he's at ­4 Dominion, the manitou may attempt to take permanent control. This works like the more temporary process described above, except that if the Harrowed loses, it's for keeps. You just gained a shiny new villain, Marshal!
Harrowed Abilities
We mentioned it above in passing, but it bears repeating: manitous have all the abilities of their host. This means that if

24
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

a Harrowed huckster loses Dominion, the demon can cast his hexes, use his Edges, and so on. The exceptions to this are powers from the Arcane Background (Miracles) and Arcane Background (Shamanism) Edges. The powers of light don't much like granting miracles to demons, so manitous aren't able to access these abilities.
The hero can still use these abilities while he's in charge, though. Despite the demon squirming around inside his noggin, the Powers That Be know the hero himself hasn't done evil, and he didn't invite his Hellish houseguest in. This means (for example) that if a manitou takes control of a blessed Harrowed, and goes on to murder someone, it doesn't count as sinning for the blessed, since he didn't commit the sin, the manitou did.
Just as manitous can use a Harrowed's abilities (in general), they cannot use any abilities the Harrowed lacks. A manitou is limited to the same bag of tricks as the shell he inhabits.
Finally, a manitou has one more important advantage. A manitou can see and hear through the Harrowed's eyes, even when the Harrowed is in control (though the reverse is not true). This makes it nearly impossible to fool a manitou into revealing its true nature unless it wants to.
Even if a clever posse does manage to trick it somehow, interrogation doesn't net much information. Manitous don't know what's going on with any other horrors in the world. Neither do they know much about the Reckoning.
They know only that they serve greater masters by sowing fear in the world, and those demons still in spirit form harvest it and take it back to the Hunting Grounds. They don't really know what

More Setting Rules
the masters do with the fear, but they do know these beings live in a place in the Hunting Grounds called the Deadlands.
Most of the time, when the manitou grabs the reins assume the character has a blackout, falls asleep, or is knocked unconscious--as far as the player knows, at least! Decide what evil deeds the manitou could reasonably have achieved during the hour(s), and what consequences are coming back to haunt the hapless Harrowed.
When surprising the rest of the posse is more important to you than keeping the Harrowed in the dark, you might let the player run his own manitou. Nothing tips off players that something isn't quite right like when the Marshal starts declaring a character's actions.

The Weird West

Hold onto your Stetson and make sure your spurs are tight, because the trail is about to get rocky. J ust around the next bend are more terrible secrets and dire dilemmas than you can shake a Buntline at.
On the following pages is a rundown of the major regions of the Weird West. You'll recognize a lot of these from their descriptions in the Player's Guide, but this time we'll actually tell you the truth.

So now you know how the West got weird and how to incorporate that weirdness into your game. The new frontier is a busy place, and there are a passel of places your posse might explore.
This chapter gives you more infor mation on all the strange locales and twisted tales mentioned in the Player's Guide, as well as information about the major players, their secrets, schemes, and hidden agendas. We'll talk a bit about the Great Rail Wars, as well, as it's a matter of special importance to the Reckoners, the evil beings that started this whole mess.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves, partner. We'll start with all you need to know about the twisted towns and creepy creeks that make up the Weird West.
Strange Locales
Within each regional description are several locations of note. Often, these are major boomtowns or cities in the region, but other significant locations--such as Worm Canyon in the Badlands or Fort 51 in the Great Basin--are listed as well.

Each region has a general Fear Level; specific locations often have their own Fear Levels that override whatever's going on in the larger area. A ghost town in the middle of Kansas, for example, has a higher Fear Level than the rest of Kansas (which is saying something, because "Bloody Kansas" is a rough place to start with).
You should add additional towns, establishments, characters, and oddities as you see fit. There's no ghost town listed in Oklahoma, for example, but it's a pretty safe bet there's more than one abandoned town in Coyote lands!
Encounter Tables
Each area described in this chapter has an Encounter Table. This is a quick way to help you play up the dangers of the wild spaces between towns. Don't worry about rolling encounters when the group is in a settlement of some sort--those places usually have plenty going on all on their own.
Each day the posse spends traveling the highways and byways of the Weird West (and isn't on a train, boat, etc.), draw a card from your Action Deck. If you draw a face card, roll on the appropriate encounter table to see what

27
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

the posse stumbles into. If you draw a Joker, the posse's in double trouble--roll twice on the appropriate encounter table and combine the results. Reshuffle the deck after every encounter.

Tell your players to take a snack break and think about the encounter a bit before setting it up. A few minutes' pause before you hit the heroes with some awful beastie or a gang of desperadoes can make a "random encounter" a much more memorable experience.

If your heroes are traveling the Chisholm Trail and you roll up a hangin' judge (see page 103), for example, don't just have the spook bump into the posse and start blazing away. Maybe at night, one of the heroes hears the judge whisper his "crimes." All the next day, the posse is stalked by a strange figure on the horizon toting a noose. The following night, the hangin' judge strides into camp while the lone hero is on watch and attempts to hang him, and the rest of the posse must struggle to save their comrade from a grisly death, despite not having the appropriate tools to knock off the abomination.

Obviously,

these

individual

encounters often lead to full-fledged

advent ures. In the above example, the

hangin' judge probably stalks the hero

until the posse manages to put it down

permanently, which means discovering

the history of the hangin' judges and

their vulnerability to a lawman's bullets

and a hanging noose.

Likewise, mundane encounters can be turned into something special with a little planning. If the heroes are traveling to Tombstone and an encounter roll results in a gang of outlaws, the heroes might have run into a group of Tombstone's Cowboy Gang. Though they manage to overcome the gang, this

creates tension for the heroes when they arrive in Tombstone, only to find one of the Cowboys escaped and warned Old Man Clanton about them.
Back East
Fear Level: 1
Whether you're in the North or South, the lay of the land Back East is entirely different than out West. For starters, there's a lot more people, places, and problems per square mile than out West. Even in the South, which is sparsely populated compared to the Northeast, you won't find the wide open spaces of the West (that's why there's no encounter table for the East, amigo, in case you were wondering). Odds are good that if you're not in a city teeming with strangers, you're trespassing on someone's land. Wide open spaces are something you read about in a travelogue.
It's surprising, then, that folks Back East are in many ways even more isolated than those in the West. With so many people around, most folks can't be bothered to give someone else the time of day, much less show any sort of kindness to a stranger. Due in part to the sense of alienation that is so common Back East, Fear Levels in the various cities can rise as high as 2, 3, or even 4.
This anonymity is also a fertile breeding ground for secrets, conspiracies, and lies, many of which stretch their twisted tendrils all the way to the West. The most prominent example in the North is the Freemason conspiracy. The South, meanwhile, still struggles with the legacy of the monster that until recently held the keys to the kingdom. Jefferson Davis, the nation's fallen leader, was a creature of unspeakable evil, and some of his cronies remain.

The Weird West

While evil lurks in the shadows of the civilized areas of the Eastern Seaboard, the region surrounding the MasonDixon Line is a war-torn no man's land. Though armies no longer tread with booted feet across the land, the bloodstained battlefields left in their wake have spawned all manner of horrors. These killing grounds often have high Fear Levels, in a few cases even reaching the status of a Deadland (Fear Level 6).
Fish Out of Water
Back East, subtlety is the order of the day, and most folks are a bit more genteel, and sport at least a veneer of civilization.
In most cities--especially the big ones--it's illegal to carry firearms, which means your posse needs to rely more on wits than gunplay. Further, thanks to

the high population density, it's tougher for ne'er-do-wells to go unnoticed, and Wanted heroes may face frequent runins with the local constabulary.
All this means the heroes may face many problems foreign to their experi ences in the West. They may have to maneuver in the murky waters of governm ent bureaucracy or rub elbows with Boston's snooty upper crust.
In short, it's the difference between the adventures of the Man With No Name and the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
The Masonic Conspiracy
The Order of the Freemasons has influenced America for some time now. The majority of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence were Masons, and the Order's power has not diminished in the intervening century.

29
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Unfortunately, the Masons have been infiltrated by a black-hearted soul named Sir Lionel Thompson.
Back in 1861, Sir Lionel was booted from the British Masonic lodge. His quest for certain knowledge "Man Was Not Meant to Know" was just too much for his fellow aristocrats. America was a bit more hospitable to British outcasts, however, so he and a dozen loyal fol lowers he'd recruited from the Order packed up their estates and moved to what the British still refer to as "the colonies."
It didn't take long for Thompson to come up with a way to regain the favor

of the British Masons--he would reclaim the American Colonies for the Crown! Ordinarily, this would've been nothing more than a pipe dream, but he soon discovered--right around the time the Reckoning began--the mystic rituals he'd been researching for so long granted him real power.
Most importantly, he found a number of mind control rituals disturbingly effective and quickly turned these toward achieving his goal. He split his followers--by now, about twenty strong--into four groups, who traveled to Masonic lodges in several US cities and insinuated themselves therein.

30
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Each of these groups had five mem bers, the minimum number required to perform Masonic magic. Once they penetrated the various lodges, Thompson's Masons used their magic to achieve positions of power and influence within the lodges, and then without. By 1879, they've woven a web of influence through mind control throughout the municipal governments of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and most importantly, Washington D.C. This presence is particularly insidious in Washington, where Thompson himself now heads the Masonic lodge, and has firm control over a large number of powerful government figures, including several ranking officers within the Agency.
Thompson's troublemaking is cur rently limited to making secret deals with the British in Detroit, but his influence over the Agency is spreading.
Davis' Legacy
Jefferson Davis is dead. You knew that, right? Well, what you might not know is that he's actually been dead for eight years, ever since the winter of 1871. While taking a lonely moonlit walk, the Confederate president was bushwhacked by a doppelganger--a shapeshifter that can disguise itself as its victims--and replaced. The doppelganger assumed Davis' consciousness and memories, but was a twisted shadow of its presidential victim.
In the time since, the doppelganger used its newfound power to wreak all sorts of havoc Back East, taking special joy in greasing the wheels of the long Civil War. Though a few--including famed Confederate General Robert E. Lee--suspected something very wrong in their young government, none could prove a thing. It didn't help that anyone who could had a tendency to die ugly.

The Weird West
Before anyone realized what was happening, Davis replaced most of his cabinet with yes-men and a few outright villains, and soon did the same with his top military staff. Lee was spared this purge, and only thanks to his popularity in the South.
In a few short years, the Davis doppelganger held the South in an iron grip, and none were powerful enough to act against him. A few brave conspirators plotted his removal, but despite their precautions, they were not beyond his reach. Robert E. Lee numbered among them, but was assassinated himself before the conspiracy of light could move against Davis. Fortunately, Lee's compatriot (and Davis' Secretary of War), Eric Michele, was able to recruit a

31
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
32
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

band of heroes to bring the President's doppelganger low.
Later, he spun an elaborate cover story, blaming the doppelganger's own lieutenant for Davis' assassination, and Michele assumed the Presidency through a vote of Davis' former cabinet.
Unfortunately, Michele doesn't realize the cabinet that he himself served on is rotten to the core. They are in the process of plotting Michele's assassination, and hatching a plan to use the murder of yet another politically powerful Confederate to enact draconian laws designed to instill fear in the soul of the South.
Trouble a-Brewin'
Despite the recent end of the Civil War, both North and South face the potential for armed conflict in the near future. In the South, Santa Anna is spoiling for a fight to reclaim Texas, and the North must deal with a British-occupied Detroit.
Unfortunately, with peace negotiations moving at a crawl, neither American nation can spare the forces to establish a strong frontier against their respective new enemies. The South, at least, has some time to maneuver, as Santa Anna has his eye on the Maze rather than the Confederacy proper, as well as an untrustworthy ally in the form of Baron Simone LaCroix.
The North, however, faces a much more immediate crisis in Detroit. On November 5, 1876, a British line division crossed the Canadian border into Michigan and seized the city of Detroit. With the Union unable to commit forces to eject the invaders thanks to the then-ongoing Civil War,

The Weird West
the British were able to fortify their positions. Tensions between the British and the Union are the worst they've been since the war of 1812, and a brand new war is liable to break out on the Union's northern border unless the British abandon their occupation.
Alas, a full scale war is exactly what the Reckoners want, for where there is fear and bloodshed, their agents are found.
Disputed Territories
Kansas, Colorado
Fear Level: 2 The Disputed Territories are about as lawless as it gets in the Weird West, thanks largely to the terms of the Civil War ceasefire. With neither North nor South allowed to deploy troops into the region, it is plagued by bandits, raiders, and outlaws who would otherwise be hunted by one federal government or another.

33
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
As far as the influence of the Reckoners goes, the Disputed Territories are largely the province of War. As such, most of the horrors the posse encounters here should be the result of violence: the Black Regiment, 'gloms, and mourning mists for example. That said, several of the more "mundane" creatures of the Reckoning can be encountered here as well, such as jackalopes, prairie ticks, and saddle burrs.
Bloody Kansas Despite the ongoing peace negotia
tions, both North and South "sponsor" partisan guerillas in the region. For the most part, these forces are supported by the Mason conspiracy (for bluebellies) or those corrupt officials left over from Davis' reign of terror (for rebs).
These vicious outlaws have been known to put entire towns to the torch, killing every man, woman, and child

in the area. The Fear Level in towns nearest these rampages often jumps to 3 overnight, while the most bitterly contested areas of the state usually hover around 4.
The most notorious of these ne'erdo-wells are Quantrill's Raiders, led by "Bloody" Bill Quantrill, and the James Gang. Ostensibly a Confederate guerilla, Quantrill is so bloodthirsty he's reviled and feared throughout Kansas, regardless of which flag a body salutes. Not even women and children are safe from the depredations of this Harrowed fiend. On the other hand, opinion on the James Gang is split. The James boys are famed for their hatred of anything north of the Mason-Dixon Line, and many diehard rebs hold them up as folk heroes. On the other hand, more sensible rebs-- and just about any Union sympathizer you care to name--revile them.

34
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Dodge City
Fear Level: 3
Dodge is a city divided. Like Kansas itself, the loyalties of Dodge's citizens are torn between North and South. Unlike most towns in Kansas, however, Yankees and Rebels live side by side in Dodge. You wouldn't think they'd tolerate each other for very long, but there's money to be made in Dodge, and that's a powerful motivator.
Unfortunately, it also means that everyone in Dodge has an axe to grind with somebody. On top of the problems with partisan violence, Dodge has to deal with two competing railroads--Black River and Union Blue--as well as a rowdy population of buffalo hunters. These buffalo hunters are themselves hunted by outlaws and Indian war parties up from Coyote lands in Oklahoma. It's a big ol' mess, so let's take things one step at a time.
Back when the city was founded by Robert Wright, he envisioned it as a place where those tired of the constant fighting in Kansas could live in peace. These days, Dodge is called "Peacetown" only with a heavy dose of irony.
The town's population grew quickly, thanks in no small part to Wright's insistence that both Black River and Union Blue be granted right-of-way through the city. This placed the city along major rail lines from both North and South, and Dodge was flooded with newcomers. Some were war-weary folks tired of living in the shooting gallery that was Kansas, others just wanted to make a buck, and a few harbored more sinister motives. Wright was elected mayor by a slim margin, and he and his town council--a group of six individuals elected to two-year terms--quickly hired a competent and well staffed police force

The Weird West
under the command of Marshal Larry Deger.
These men strive to enforce the law without bias toward Union or Confederate sympathizers, though some live up to this lofty ideal better than others. Five deputies have already been dismissed after complaints of favoritism. Even Deger's job is in danger, though this is more due to a popular movement to elect Deputy Wyatt Earp to the job than any charges of bias leveled against Deger.
The most controversial law in Dodge is the prohibition against firearms within city limits. With all the violence committed in Dodge, the Council thought it wise to force people to resort to fisticuffs rather than more lethal--and permanent--solutions. Anyone arriving in town is required to head for the marshal's station and check his guns, where they are given a claim slip in

35
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

return. The bearer can return a claim slip for the weapon upon leaving Dodge.
Of course it often turns out that the owner of the gun and the bearer of the claim slip are not the same person. A brisk black market trade in claim slips has sprung up since the law's enactment, and slips have been stolen, lost, traded, and even wagered in poker games. Carrying a weapon in Dodge can lead to a jail term of up to three months, confiscation of the weapon, and a $50 fine per violation.
Of course, even without guns, Dodge is a violent city. Fist fights routinely break out between Rebel and Yankee neighbors. Worse, Dodge often plays host to one of the many bands of partisan raiders that roam Kansas. These armed groups tend to ignore the gun laws, and even Wyatt Earp--renowned for his steely will and cool head--is loathe to challenge them for fear of a war breaking out between the law and the raiders.

The Meat Market
Most folks looking to make a legal buck in Dodge do so in either buffalo hunting or the cattle trade, or else by catering to those who do.
Buffalo hunting is the perfect job for those who enjoy gunning down animals too stupid to run away, and it's an easy business to get into. All you really need is a good rifle, a wagon to haul the carcasses, and a crew to lift the carcass onto the wagon! Crews of skinners--men willing to perform the grunt work of buffalo hunting, including skinning the carcasses and hauling them to town--usually work for about 10% of the buffalo hunter's take. Buffalo hunters themselves can make anywhere from $15 to $30 per buffalo, depending on size, freshness, and quality. Several slaughterhouses in town split up the animal and ship the meat and various bits out on the railroads. Of course, where there's money, there

36
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

are outlaws and thieves. Buffalo hunters are constantly under the threat of attack by other hunters looking to steal their haul, bandits looking to steal their cash, or Coyote raiders looking to steal their scalps.
Only marginally more civilized than the buffalo hunters are the cattlemen who drive Texas longhorns to Dodge for shipment on one of the rail lines. Cattle owners associations out West have forged exclusive deals with their local railroads to haul their beeves and no one else's, forcing many of the smalltime operations to drive their longhorns north all the way to Dodge.
Both of these groups, once they collect their pay (either from the slaughterhouses or the trail bosses) hit the town with a vengeance, boozing and gambling away most of their hard-earned cash. Worse, buffalo hunters have been known occasionally to "accidentally" pick off stray longhorns, so tensions between

The Weird West
these two groups often boil over into drunken brawls.
City of Intrigue
With easy access to Dodge by rail from both North and South, the city is an ideal jumping-off point for spies headed for enemy territory. This also means that both nations have an extensive spy network in place. Some provide false papers and safehouses for agents headed across the Mason-Dixon Line, while others stay in contact with the many partisan raiders in Kansas and provide guns and supplies to keep the "war effort" alive. Of course, with Black River and Union Blue both present in force, corporate spies are common as well.
All of these factions devote an unhealthy amount of time to ferreting out each other's agents and bumping them off in creative ways. The Texas Rangers, the Agency, Black River, Union Blue, and a number of freelancers all

37
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
dance this deadly waltz, and hardly a night goes by that somebody doesn't disappear without a trace.
The law in Dodge takes a dim view of all this cloak and dagger business, and anyone convicted of spying in Dodge-- whether Union or Confederate, Indian or rail man, or even a citizen of Deseret-- hangs.
City of Ghouls Most folks who spend any amount
of time in Dodge hear tell of the body snatchers. Depending on who you talk to, these nasties loot the dead, eat the dead, or even raise the dead. They're described as anything from little green men, to shambling corpses, to pink elephants. Some of these stories are even true.
Naturally, a good chunk of those who disappear are merely victims of one of the many intrigues and vendettas so common in Dodge, so no supernatural explanation is really needed, or widely believed. That said, a colony of ghouls has dug out a warren beneath Boot Hill.
Colorado
Fear Level: 2
As yet, Colorado hasn't been engulfed in the partisan violence so common in Kansas. That said, bands of vicious raiders occasionally lie low in Colorado when things get too hot for them farther East. Colorado towns nearest Kansas have occasionally been overrun by raiders, though usually in a figurative sense. These rowdy bands often ride into Colorado towns for a little "relaxation," which pretty much means drunken brawls, casual murder, and...well, let's just say raiders are an ungentlemanly lot, and don't often take `no' for an answer.

This has caused quite an outcry in Denver, where Mayor Hornsby--the de facto governor of the territory, what with the Confederate and Union provisional governments more or less canceling out each others' efforts--has been petitioned to do everything, from declare for the Union or Confederacy in the hope of military assistance, to raise a Denver Defense Brigade of soldiers.
The wicked agents of the Reckoning tend to operate in a more subtle fashion in Colorado than in Kansas. War's minions are rarely born of violence, but more frequently sow the seeds of violence themselves.
Tragic but deadly weeping widows mourn husbands and sons killed in battles long past; humbugs play on folks' nerves, often leading to violence; ghost trains wipe out entire towns, leaving ignorant survivors to blame the Union or Confederacy for the bloodshed.
And, if that weren't enough trouble to look out for, there are all too many mundane foes roaming the territory as well--outlaws and raiders for whom causing misery is a favorite pastime.

The Great Basin
Southern California, Nevada
Fear Level: 1
Southern California and Nevada form the Great Basin. This arid land is mostly desert, though water can be found if one knows where to look. That said, a cowpoke who knows what's good for him won't venture out in this region without a map, several weeks' provisions, and a lot of water.
To the east of Death Valley, the Great Basin is Death's territory, and it shows. The region is as liable to eat a man alive--sometimes literally--as it is to let him escape. Mojave rattlers, dust devils, tumblebleeds, and their ilk are common threats here, as are starvation, thirst, and exposure.
In southern California one also has to keep his eyes peeled for the Mexican Army--Santa Anna's forces mount fre

The Weird West
quent border raids, and full-scale attacks upon Confederate outposts in the region.
Death Valley
Fear Level: 5
Death Valley is one of the hottest places on earth--maybe even the hottest. Only the hardiest sort manage to survive here, including a few prospectors who scratch a living out of the volcanic mountains.
The lower portions of the valley are covered in salt flats, left behind by a rare wash from the Amargosa River, which is usually dry as a bone but fills with a few inches of water about three times a year.
Bizarrely, a few prospectors have reported someone is laying track through the region. Most speculate (accurately, as it happens) that it's Bayou Vermilion, as it lays down a path toward Lost Angels rail by rail. No one's gotten close enough for a look, though, thanks to hungry patrols of brain-seeking zombies.

39
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

Baron LaCroix isn't worried, largely because his workers dropped dead years ago. His rail crews in the Valley consist entirely of walkin' dead. The dry environment is ideal for the hard workin' stiffs, as it helps preserve their undead flesh, and they toil away in both baking heat of the day and chill of the desert night.
Fort 51
Fear Level: 0
Fort 51 is the Union's answer to the Confederate base at Roswell, and all manner of experiments are conducted here at all hours of the day. Seventeen scientists and their families live on the base, overseen by "Mr. Eddington," a mysterious, secretive type who rarely

speaks and never smiles, but keeps his nose in every experiment.
Officially, however, the base is home to Captain Jay Kyle's Flying Buffalos. Some time ago, Kyle's men suffered greatly from Apache snipers who positioned themselves high in the surrounding terrain. Being a wealthy individual, Kyle sprung for five Smith & Robards rocket packs. These proved invaluable in fighting the Apaches, and Kyle now has an entire regiment trained in the use of the rocket packs. He has about 50 of the powerful devices available, though only 40 can usually be operated at any one time (the rest are in for repairs). Whenever the Federals mount a raid into Apache territory, the Flying Buffalos are the only choice.

40
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Lately, however, Kyle has noticed that more of his rocket packs than usual are in for repairs at any given time. Though he's pressed Eddington for an explanation on more than one occasion, the man simply refuses to answer.
Mr. Eddington is actually a highranking Agent, and has been issuing the rocket packs to a few of his cold-blooded compatriots. These Agents use the rocket packs to fly out to Apache territory and test Fort 51's latest weapon designs on the Apaches, with little care for any innocents that may be harmed.
The Ghost Trail
Fear Level: 3
The Ghost Trail used to run to Santa Fe, where it became the Santa Fe Trail. It came to life in '69, when Southerners used it to ship ghost rock to Roswell for Jeff Davis' attack on Washington. Since Roswell exploded, the contractors working for the government move their loads to the railhead at Tombstone instead.
Bandits and thieves are common along the Ghost Trail, as are the restless spirits of their victims.
The Mojave Desert
Fear Level: 4
The Mojave is a huge expanse of barren land in southern California. Part of the desert is hard and brittle, with only a few stray cacti and dry scrubs scattered across the landscape. The rest is made up of shifting sand dunes and bizarre rock formations.
There isn't much reason for sane folks to head out into the Mojave. A few of the crazy sort, however, make an honest--if dangerous--buck hunting Mojave rat tlers.

The Great Maze
California
Fear Level: 2
The broken landscape of the Maze is a magnificent sight. From certain vantage points, a cowpoke can see thousands of settlements. Some are perched atop the many mesas, while others rest in the rubbled sea canyons below.
Everywhere one looks, hopeful prospectors chip away at the cliff faces for gold, silver, or ghost rock. Below, ore barges scud back and forth in bluegreen Pacific waters. The lucky ones are guarded by Federal or Confederate ironclads--those less fortunate are sometimes preyed upon by pirates and raiders. The wider channels host a variety of colorful vessels, ranging from Kang's sampans and junks to the heavily armed flotillas of the Mexican Armada.
The Maze is Famine's territory. The inland side of California is dry and vegetation is sparse, making it difficult to grow or hunt for food in the region.

41
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
42
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Farther out in the Maze, potable water is extremely rare, as most sources of fresh water west of Lost Angels were ruined when the waters of the Pacific flooded the Maze. A few areas inland support small herds of cattle, but prairie ticks and Texas fever ravage the beeves on a regular basis. Folks in Lost Angels pay about six times the normal prices for meat or fresh fruits and vegetables, and not even water is free in the Maze. Folks farther out in the Maze have it even worse, sometimes paying as much as $20 for a single steak of even the rangiest quality.
Let's start at the center of it all, Marshal.
The City of Lost Angels
Fear Level: 5
At the point where the broken landscape meets what remains of California is the City of Lost Angels, perched atop the low inland cliffs overlooking Prosperity Bay. Let's talk about how it got there.
In the wake of the Great Quake of '68, the survivors made their way inland as best they could. It was an incredible journey. Besides the lack of food and fresh water, the refugees had to cross shark-infested sea channels and scale rugged mesa walls.
The most successful of these groups was led by a preacher named Ezekiah Grimme, who somehow managed to provide food and water for his followers on their pilgrimage. When they arrived at the inland side of the Maze to find a natural spring, Grimme proclaimed the pilgrims' journey complete, and proclaimed the site a new home for his "Lost Angels."
The newly founded City of Lost Angels grew slowly but steadily until the discovery of gold in the Maze, and later ghost rock. When the rush began in

The Weird West
earnest, Grimme's sanctuary became the natural shipping point for everything coming into and out of the Maze.
As such, the City of Lost Angels is a haven in the barren landscape of what's left of California. But danger, deceit, and treachery lie beneath the surface of Grimme's West Coast paradise.
The Church of Lost Angels
Grimme still leads his Lost Angels in worship to this day, and his sermons are pure fire and brimstone. Most folks in the city are members of the church in body, if not in spirit. The weekly feasts held after mass make for a lot of fairweather faithful.
A Devil in Shepherd's Clothing
As you may have guessed by now, Marshal, there's more to Grimme than meets the eye, and the same goes for the true believers who follow him. Here's what really happened to Grimme all those years ago.
When he led the survivors of the quake inland, food was scarce as hens' teeth. Some of his flock resorted to cannibalism out of necessity, but Grimme himself, being a man of God, refused to partake. The pious Grimme was killed along with many of his followers, who remained stalwart. The Reckoners sensed the strength of the man even in death, and seized the opportunity to make something new and terrifying in his image.
That night, after the cannibals had consumed Grimme's flesh, a dark miracle took place. His bones grew bloody, then oozing sinews and gory flesh wrapped themselves around Grimme's skeleton. When the spectacle was over, Grimme had returned, tattered black priest's garb and all. But this was not the good-hearted man who led his flock from the ruins of California and resisted the temptation

43
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

to feast upon human flesh; this was an abomination created by the Reckoners to take full advantage of the situation.
The new Reverend Grimme had none of the qualms of the old. He embraced cannibalism wholeheartedly. In fact, he ordered his starving companions, now devout converts to their risen leader's word, to seek out other refugees and harvest them for their meat. So Grimme led his disciples on a bloody trek through the shattered remains of California. The unholy pilgrims soon reached the future site of the City of Lost Angels, and refugees from across the Maze converged upon the camp.
With the eyes of thousands upon him, Grimme took a more subtle tack. He provided food and shelter for the new arrivals, while his inner circle quietly picked off the weak as they slept.
The camp soon became a town, and within three years, it grew into a city with a population just shy of 20,000. The City of Lost Angels was born, and Grimme's faithful gained a huge herd of human cattle upon which to feast.
Grimme established the Church of Lost Angels to maintain his own power within the growing community. He secretly does everything he can to keep food prices high, often using his dark powers to blight crops and inflict disease

upon cattle herds that arrive in his city. This makes him that much more popular when his church serves a feast of mystery meats (accompanied by vegetables watered with the blood of his victims) to the starving citizens. The nature of Grimme's dark religion prevents his followers from transforming into ghouls or wendigos, the fate of most cannibals.
Needless to say, the feasts make Grimme a popular figure. Most members of the Church of Lost Angels believe him to be a magnanimous benefactor. Only his inner circle--the Cult of Lost Angels--knows the horrific truth. For more details on the Cult of Lost Angels itself, see the Encounters chapter (starting on page 75).
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
It didn't take long for Grimme to figure that he might, at some point, need to perform a miracle or two in public, and he knew his black magic wouldn't exactly endear him to God-fearing folk. With that in mind, he arranged a ritual designed to disguise his dark magics as miracles from Heaven.
One Sunday back in '76, a horde of demons invaded the Church of Lost Angels during Grimme's sermon. They slaughtered a whole passel of

44
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

churchgoers, and it appeared to the survivors that Grimme drove the demons off with his holy powers.
In truth, the demons were in cahoots with Grimme, and the murders they committed were part of a bloody ritual. This ritual created a "safe zone" for Grimme, a 75-mile-radius area centered on Lost Angels, in which his black magic and that of his followers is disguised as divine miracle.
Grimme's priests can even take a chunk of his altar with them to maintain the illusion farther abroad. These altar shards are extremely valuable to his cultists, and they would die before parting with one.
He followed this little miracle up with the Edict of '77, which we told you about in the Player's Guide, in which he started to make his big play for the whole of California.
The Commonwealth of California
Fear Level: 2
As we mentioned in the Player's Guide, the good (and evil) folks of California voted on which flag they should salute a while back. Thing is, most folks voted for neither, instead electing to pursue an independent Californian nation. Grimme seized upon this opportunity following his Edict of '77 and declared the City of Lost Angels sovereign territory. Though he claims all of California as his bailiwick, Reverend Grimme's power really only extends about 75 miles (the area in which his unholy miracles can be disguised as blessings from above). Beyond that, the Maze is pretty much up for grabs.
While everyone fights over the Maze, wily merchants butter their bread on both sides by selling gold and ghost rock to both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line.

The Weird West
The Struggle for the Maze
Unfortunately for Reverend Grimme, he's not the only one with his eye on this prize. Leaving aside the many boomtowns not beholden to any particular lord (other than the almighty dollar to be had mining the mesa walls for ghost rock), several factions vie for control of this rich region.
The Union and the Confederacy each maintains a Pacific fleet, stationed in crude harbors and strongholds scattered throughout the Maze. They engaged in battle frequently during the war, but large naval engagements were difficult to commit to, thanks largely to the challenge of maneuvering a single vessel--much less a fleet--through the twisting channels of the Maze. Instead, the fleets would patrol the tight confines of the canyons and attempt to lure smaller forces out to open water.
The uneasy truce has not led to a slackening of patrols in the fractured canyons, however, as the North and South aren't the only fighters in this particular ring. The Chinese warlords make a strong claim on the region surrounding Dragon's Breath and Shan Fan, while

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Santa Anna's Mexican Armada scores victory after victory as it attacks and occupies settlements throughout the region. The Union and Confederacy fleets combined are outnumbered by the ships of the Mexican Armada, and very few escape Santa Anna's reign of terror. Those who do report horrors beyond belief.
Brown Water Navies
The Union fleet is a collection of small, open boats with steam-driven propellers. Few sport guns of any kind, though their crews are armed with a variety of personal firearms. The Confederate Navy is even worse off. Until recently, it granted letters of marque to some of the more notorious rogue pirates, though these "licensed pirates" were cut loose as the ceasefire called a halt to the Civil War. Unfortunately, many raiders continue to fly Confederate flags, causing the mistaken, though reasonable, assumption they still operate under Confederate authority.
Unlike either of these forces, the Mexican Armada is both well-equipped and highly trained. It consists of both fast clipper ships that patrol the coast and sturdy ironclads that patrol the channels of the Maze itself.
Collectively, the Armada is the terror of the Maze. The few ships of the Union and Confederate Pacific Navies are no match for the flotilla, either within the Maze or along the coast. Most assume it is only a matter of time before Mexican troops make landfall and attempt to conquer large swaths of the Maze.
Finally, there are the numerous rogues and pirates of the Maze, who ply the waterways picking off lone vessels in search of a rich haul. Many of these are sole operators, but a number are minions

of the various Chinese warlords who make the Maze their home.
The Chinese Warlords
Chinese immigrant labor is a vital part of the Western economy, but the laborers themselves find conditions in the West hard and they are often poorly treated.
The Chinese warlords of the Maze build their fortresses high atop the small but high-walled islands in the heart of the Maze. When these men established their strongholds in California, they each brought with them scores of their own warriors. The Chinese already living in the Maze, tired of the oppression of the white man, flocked to their colorful banners by the score.
Most of these warlords have so many followers they cannot hope to house them all within the walls of their island fortresses. Each overcrowded fortress hosts a small fleet of sampans of various sizes and levels of quality, each docked to one another and floating in nearby channels. When traveling the Maze, your first clue that you're approaching a warlord's fortress is likely the variegated sails of these colorful floating sampan cities.
These warlords are hardly confined to the Maze itself. Some, like the infamous General Kwan or Wang Ti-P'ing Hsien (the so-called "King of the Horizon") control a fair amount of real estate inland.
Kang
Of all the Chinese warlords, the enig matic Kang is by far the most powerful. His forces include legions of highly trained warriors, many of whom study ancient Chinese martial secrets.
Kang's boats scour the interior of the Maze seeking out prospector's camps and newly founded boomtowns (which seem to spring up overnight on the

46

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
mesas). When they find one, they send their spies to seek out the owners of any ghost rock strikes in the area. If the spies uncover any worthy strikes--really, any ghost rock strike at all--Kang's warriors move in and claim the strike for their own. He controls every ghost rock strike within fifty miles or so of his fortress (called Dragon's Breath), as well as a few scattered farther out in the Maze.
Shan Fan
Fear Level: 3
The Chinese warlords can all count on one safe haven in the Maze: the port city of Shan Fan, located about 300 miles north of Lost Angels.
While not as large or important as Lost Angels, Shan Fan holds its own, acting as a stop-off point for ghost rock shipments heading south, as well as a convenient place for Maze pirates to fence their illgotten gains.
Rather than any sort of elected government, Shan Fan is run by a triad. The Shan Fan Triad--the most powerful in California--is run by Big Ears Tam,

who oversees all of Shan Fan. Every tong gang in the city pays tribute to Tam. Kang has promised one of Tam's lieutenants, Thin Noodles Ma, aid in his effort to overthrow the old man in return for right-of-way through Shan Fan. If the scheme is successful, Kang will have the city in his pocket, and a steadfast and powerful ally at the head of the triad.
Despite the triads' criminal endeavors in California--they run an assortment of gambling halls, opium dens, and prostitution rings--they're popular with the miners. Further, since they're in charge of Shan Fan and everyone knows it, their business interests aren't actually illegal at all. Violence between the various gangs occasionally claims a bystander or two, but on the whole, the tongs keep their turf wars contained and inflict few casualties on innocent bystanders.
Santa Anna's Crusade
The rumors regarding Santa Anna's plans are true. The Mexican General has his eye on all of California (and most of the Confederate South, truth be told).
In addition to his bargain with Baron Simone LaCroix, Santa Anna has struck a deal with an ancient evil born in the days of the Aztecs. Xitlan (Eetlawn) is an Aztec sorcerer who swore vengeance upon the white man when his civilization was destroyed centuries ago. As far as Xitlan is concerned, Santa Anna's as guilty as the next man, but his desire for conquest makes him a handy tool for killing the next man. Xitlan plans to aid the general in conquering the Maze, and then seize it for his own purposes (those purposes being using it as a defensible staging area from which to launch his Army of the Dead against the white invaders).
In the meantime, Santa Anna and Xitlan enjoy an uneasy alliance. Only a

48
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

small portion of Santa Anna's forces are made up of Mexican regulars, largely because he mistrusts them for cowards after they failed him in his 1836 and 1848 campaigns. The lion's share of Santa Anna's forces are rotting undead animated by Xitlan. The Aztec sorcerer controls his zombies with a special herb mixture called plantagrito, which is ground into their usual diet of raw meat.
Santa Anna knows he won't be able to occupy with this force, and doesn't particularly care. He just wants to give Maximillian a victory so the Emperor will give him another crack at Texas. By this time, Santa Anna's so far `round the bend that it doesn't occur to him Maximillian might want to reap some benefit from his conquest.
Regardless, Santa Anna has gradually been shipping his Army of the Dead into the area via LaCroix's Bayou Vermilion rail line, and is only a few months shy of launching his invasion.

The Great Northwest
Washington, Oregon, Idaho Fear Level: 1 At first glance, the beautiful landscape of the Great Northwest is serene and

peaceful. The mist-shrouded base of Mount Rainier, the snowy evergreens of the Cascade Mountains, and the crystal lakes lure a man like a siren's call.
Don't be fooled. The howls in the night are more than just the wind.
The Great Northwest belongs to Famine. Many a pioneer has starved to death in her clutches, only to be frozen and buried in a blizzard come down off the mountains.
In such conditions, where escape is impossible and food scarce, many God-fearing folk have been forced to do things they would otherwise shudder to consider. What most don't realize is there's a terrible price to pay for any who surrenders to the cannibalistic urge.
Worse, many have fallen victim to the various primordial peoples who call the area home. Wolflings, sasquatches, and wendigos all claim the Cascade Mountains as their territory, and humans are often caught in the midst of their ferocious winter wars. The Fear Level in areas commonly hunted by wolflings and wendigos often rises as high as 3, or even 4, as horror stalks through the northern forests.
Sasquatches
The Salish Indians of Seattle believe sasquatches live in tremendous, hollowed-out tree trunks high in the Cascade Mountains. They're right, too. Where the Salish are wrong, however, is their belief that sasquatches remain, as they always have been in the past, benevolent protectors of nature, harmless to those who treat the land with respect.
Long ago, sasquatches existed in harmony with the Salish, but with the increase in numbers of their age-old enemies, the wendigos (see below), the sasquatch have adopted a fierce stance

50
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

toward those who could become such creatures. Their solution to the problem is simple, but brutal.
Where once the sasquatch attempted to provide starving men and women with food, while still remaining out of sight, they now murder these people rather than allow them the opportunity to engage in cannibalism. Entire villages have been wiped out by the sasquatch during particularly harsh winters.
Sasquatches are truly intelligent beings, though they are primitive. They are crafty woodsmen, and make use of simple tools and clever traps to both hunt and elude the eyes of man. They do not know the secret of fire, though they are fascinated by the dancing light and take pleasure in basking in its warmth given the opportunity.
Though the potential for peace between man and sasquatch exists, the sasquatch practice of exterminating any who are in danger of starvation is slowly corrupting the gentle souls of this primitive species, and driving the human population to fear and hate them.
Wendigos
The mountains of the Northwest grow deathly cold in the winter. Survival is always a trial, especially the quest for food. When the chips are down, some humans engage in the horrible practice of cannibalism to survive. The Indians of the area abhor the idea, but are not immune to temptation. The result of this ultimate sin is transformation into a wendigo.
Should a character ever resort to cannibalism while in the Great Northwest (for any reason), he must make a Spirit roll to avoid conversion

The Weird West
into a wendigo. He suffers a cumulative ­1 penalty to this roll for each act of cannibalism, and a ­2 if it occurs during the winter.
If he fails, the fallen hero becomes a wendigo under the Marshal's control. There's no way to get the hero back, so go ahead and tell the player to make a new one.
For details on these nasty critters, see page 139.
Wolflings
The settlers and Indians of Washington don't agree on much, but they do agree the wolves of the area are dangerous predators. Local Indian lore goes one step further, and describes half-human, half-wolf creatures with coats of pure white. These feral creatures supposedly live in the lost valleys of the Cascade Mountains and venture out only to prey on mankind.
Wolflings are comparable to sas quatches insofar as their understanding of basic tools goes. They have both fingers and opposable thumbs, and often use crude hand weapons in their hunts. They occasionally wear jewelry, scarves, and other articles of clothing claimed from their victims.

51
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Since sasquatches tend to wander alone, wolflings have preyed upon them for generations. That said, wolflings much prefer the savory taste of manflesh.

Fear Level: 2
To an innicent visitor, the northern area of the Great Plains looks harmless at first glance. The low rolling hills seem open and inviting, and the gently swaying grasses seem incapable of concealing danger.
However, no place in the Weird West is what it first seems. These seemingly idyllic surroundings conceal countless horrific creatures behind nearly every hill. In the tall grass, fiends with bloodshot eyes and dripping fangs silently stalk lone travelers for meat--or entertainment.

52
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

The Badlands
Fear Level: 4
The Badlands south of the Black Hills host many natural (and supernatural) dangers. These twisted foothills of the Rocky Mountains are home to all manner of predators--some human, some less so.
Even though the Californian desert is far from here, the occasional sighting of Mojave rattlers is enough to keep travelers on their toes.
It is not uncommon to encounter marauding Sioux war parties either. Belligerent young braves occasionally roam the Badlands looking to exact a little vengeance for the white man's incursion into the sacred Black Hills.
The twisted valleys and canyons of the Badlands are home to swarms of devil bats who protect their aeries fiercely. They've been so effective in their hunts that the Fear Level of the area has shot up to 4 over the last couple of years.
Worm Canyon
Fear Level: 5
There is an even more sinister evil at work in the Badlands. Worm Canyon, deep in the heart of the Badlands, is a labyrinthine area that is home to a number of giant worms similar to Utah and Mojave rattlers.
Here also lives a black sorceress named Ursula and her twisted followers, who worship the rattlers as gods. She and her coven of witches wound up in the area after narrowly escaping the Agency, only to be cornered by a pack of rattlers. Ursula was taken aback when the lead rattler whispered in her mind, but she didn't hesitate to fulfill its demand for a sacrifice. She shoved one of her followers off a cliff and into the creature's maw.
Since then, Ursula has been both the rattlers' prisoner and queen. She entraps

The Weird West
travelers for sacrifice to the worms, but if she fails to do so for too long, the worms demand one of her coven. By now, she's about as crazy as an outhouse rat.

Deseret
Utah Fear Level: 3 Mormons, or Latter-Day Saints, are God-fearing folks who believe Christ visited America following his resur rection. They also believe Joseph Smith, their first prophet, was visited by an angel who gave him a set of golden

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

plates that described the flight of God's chosen people from the Holy Lands to the Americas. Other than this, and their continuing practice of polygamy, their beliefs aren't all that different from many Christians. Nonetheless, it didn't take long for them to be driven out of their homes in Kansas and Missouri. They fled west to Utah, and founded Salt Lake City in 1847.
Brigham Young, Joe Smith's successor as leader of the Mormon people, declared the Utah territory the independent "State of Deseret" in 1866. Though at first he declared that Deseret's loyalties lay with the Union, the arrival of Professor Darius Hellstromme in 1870 changed everything.

The Doctor Is In
The Mormons were initially slow to accept this new arrival, but his invention of the steam wagon, a device that aided the Mormons greatly in dealing with-- read that as escaping--the rattlers of the Utah salt flats, made him their new favorite person. Soon, the incredible factories of Hellstromme Industries, Ltd. brought jobs and wealth to the Mormons, who until then had struggled to prosper in the hostile Utah territory.
Most importantly, his inventions greatly enhanced the capabilities of the Mormons' own army, the Nauvoo Legion. Suddenly, the Mormons were Hellstromme's biggest boosters, and it

54
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

didn't take long for him to be accepted among the Latter-Day Saints as a true believer. Little did they know the Servitor of Pestilence now walked among them.
At this point, the technology that has infected their society is taken as just another side-effect of modern life.
The City o' Gloom
Fear Level: 4
Salt Lake City, popularly called the City o' Gloom, is the most technologically advanced city in the world. Thousands of high voltage wires and pipes bearing natural gas sprawl through the urban tangle, bringing light, heat, and electricity to those who can afford it.
Salt Lake City's mechanization does not come without a cost, however. The once-clean city now lies hidden beneath a pall of dirty smog. It's also attracted a rogue's gallery of prospectors, former rail warriors, and settlers down on their luck and hoping for a job in one of Hellstromme's many factories.
Most of these lost souls never leave the city's factory district, known locally as the Junkyard. Even in this grimy subsection, life in the city is incredibly expensive, so laborers usually find themselves trapped in an endless cycle of wage slavery. Life is cheap in the Junkyard, but death can often be a money-spinner. Various blood sports are a common entertainment in the Junkyard, and some factory workers have been known to wager a week's salary on a single event.
Sandwiched between the Junkyard and the Wasatch Mountains are the city's many ore mining facilities, all mechanized thanks to Hellstromme's technological assistance. The lucky few who land jobs working the mines are able to escape the choking smog of Junkyard, only to risk life and limb operating

The Weird West
Hellstromme's enormous digging and ore transport machines.
Despite the rapid advance of technology in the city, the Mormons themselves have weathered the change somewhat better than their neighbors in the Junkyard. The heavy, clinging smog only rarely drifts across the area of the Holy City reserved for Mormons, and those few Mormons who take jobs in the Junkyard fill managerial positions thanks to the devout Hellstromme, rather than any of the more menial, dirty positions.
Hellstromme, the Man
Darius Hellstromme is careful to cultivate a pious and cultured front for his new Mormon friends. For privacy, he lives about 10 miles west of the city, at the very edge of the salt flats. His manor is surrounded by a walled compound with barbed wire, hired gunmen, guard dogs, clockwork tarantulas, and even an automaton or twelve.
The peculiarity of such a man of influence and alleged benevolence requiring such protection is of some concern to many Mormons, but far more see only the benefits Hellstromme has brought to Salt Lake City.
For his part, Brigham Young is all too aware that Hellstromme's facade is a far cry from the truth, but he also knows Hellstromme's innovations and assistance have been invaluable in the establishment of an independent Mormon nation. Young still hopes to turn Hellstromme away from the darkness and into the love of God.
Hellstromme, the Monster
If only the Latter-Day Saints knew what Hellstromme really got up to in that isolated mansion of his, they'd give

55
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
him the boot faster than you can say "human test subjects."
Being a genius, Hellstromme is one of the few folks who suspects the true significance of the events surrounding the Reckoning, and one of fewer still who have surmised that powerful beings-- the Reckoners--are behind them.
The trouble is, Hellstromme simply doesn't give a whit. Some time ago, his beloved wife Vanessa committed suicide, and the event nearly shattered him. Only the Reckoning gives him hope now, for he sees that the spirit world can once more be accessed from our own, and that death need no longer be the end. He hopes the Reckoning will eventually give him the means to somehow resurrect his lost love, and this terrible fascination drives his every endeavor.
All of his factories, inventions, and even the Wasatch Rail Co. itself are simply a means to gather funds for his experiments in terror. Late at night, Hellstromme probes the mysteries of the Reckoning by building up the Fear

Level in his personal laboratories and observing the odd phenomena which occur in his various test subjects, both living and dead (and occasionally, undead). With every ghastly experiment he hopes to discover some vital clue that will lead to a reunion with his beloved Vanessa.

Fear Level: 3
Indians are an enigma to most white folks. Some are noble and honorable, others savage and cruel. The truth is, they're just plain folks, whether good, bad, or indifferent. Each tribe has its own culture, which may seem strange to those from more "civilized" parts of the world. Even more confusing to whites, the customs of these people are as varied as the people themselves.
There are literally hundreds of different tribes in the West, but three groups have the most influence. From largest to smallest, they are the Sioux, the Coyote Confederation, and the Apache. The Apache are covered in the Wild Southwest.

56
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

The Sioux Nations
The Sioux Nations were formed in 1872, when the Union's defeat at the Battle of Washington convinced the tribes of the Dakotas it was time to move to exploit the situation and reclaim their borders. Sitting Bull started this movement, but even he could not make the tribes unite under a single leader. Instead, the tribes reinstated the old council of the Sioux Nations, the wicasa yatapickas. The wicasas are four wise leaders appointed by the tribes to make decisions on behalf of the Nations. Any formal dealings with the Sioux must be carried out through these men.
The four tribes directly represented by the wicasas are the Hunkpapa, Miniconjou, Brule, and Oglalas. The other tribes of the Sioux Nations, including the Northern Cheyenne and the Sans Arcs, must win the ear of one of the wicasas to air their grievances.
Relations with the US
At the moment, relations between the Sioux and the United States are cool, at best. Sioux are allowed to travel at will, though any group greater than five in Union territory is considered a "raiding party," and is given an armed escort back to Sioux lands by the local cavalry.
The reverse is also true, only even more so. No whites are allowed in Sioux lands except by the Iron Dragon rail line (or the quasi-legal stage line that runs beside it). Even then, visitors must head directly to the treaty city of Deadwood, or to one of the few areas in the Black Hills where the Sioux have allowed mining. Anyone foolish enough to wander out of these areas and into the sacred lands of the Sioux is unlikely to be seen again.
The locals protest these "murders" to the US government, but the response is always a blunt, "You were warned."

The Weird West
The Old Ways
As discussed in the Deadlands Player's Guide, the Old Ways movement is law in the Sioux Nations (though it is resented by some and ignored by others). Secretly, Sitting Bull himself is actually a Ravenite. Even with his power, revelation of his political leanings would likely result in his execution by order of his colleagues. Instead, he has quietly organized the Ravenites and provided them with guns and other equipment from behind the scenes.
Now Sitting Bull bides his time, waiting for some incident to turn popular opinion against the Old Ways, at which time he can depose the other wicasas and declare himself the Great Chief. The Battle of Little Bighorn, where the followers of the Old Ways triumphed over Custer's US cavalry, set him back several years.

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
who fights back is killed, and his corpse mounted on poles along the trail to the Black Hills as a warning to other miners.
Deadwood
Fear Level: 3
Deadwood is a wild place. Over a third of the population makes its living from saloons, gambling, or prostitution. The knowledge that the Sioux could decide to wipe out the town any day lurks in the back of every citizen's mind, and most eat, drink, and make merry, for they might never see tomorrow. This kind of debauchery just over the horizon is a powerful tool for Sitting Bull, as it's clear that though the Old Ways bought the Sioux their freedom, they didn't keep the white man off of their land.
Despite the perception of the Sioux, Marshal Seth Bullock and his deputies do their best to keep the peace and

round up any errant drunks. He tries to keep violence to a minimum--especially when the Sioux are mixed up in an incident--but things don't always work out the way he'd like.
Most folks don't actually live within city limits, instead camping out in the hills overlooking the town. Some miners refuse to leave their stakes for fear claim jumpers will rob them blind. The Sioux leave the miners alone, provided they don't wander off their registered claims.
The Office of Indian Affairs
Speaking of registering claims, all miners are required to register their claims through the Office of Indian Affairs, which is run by a man named Joseph Bearclaw. He's a slick-talking lawyer educated Back East, but his parentage is Lakota Sioux. He's not real popular out in the Black Hills, but he's a necessary evil in the eyes of most

58
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Sioux. After all, they'd rather have him running their business affairs in town than a white man. Even so, if it weren't for Sitting Bull speaking on Bearclaw's behalf, it's unlikely the Sioux would trust him as far as they can throw him, and some still don't.
Sitting Bull, for his part, trusts Bearclaw implicitly, though not for the reason most Sioux believe. Bearclaw, like Sitting Bull, is a Ravenite. The two are plotting together to cause a bit more bloodshed between the whites and Indians than would otherwise occur, and Sitting Bull hopes to use the growing tensions to turn popular opinion among the Sioux against the Old Ways movement.
Chinatown
A large number of Chinese imm i grants have set up housekeeping at the north end of town. Most work Iron Dragon-owned mines in the Black Hills (purchased through employees to circumvent the prohibition against company-owned mines), while others make a living as servants. Many have gone into business themselves. Some run laundries and restaurants, while others cater to less wholesome tastes.
Just on the north side of the Iron Dragon tracks, there are a number of establishments that serve customers looking for something a little stronger than whiskey. At night, you can smell the burning opium from a block away. Kang's man Huang Li runs these establishments, as well as a string of brothels. He is widely recognized by Deadwood's Chinese residents as their leader, though few outsiders even know he exists.
Wild Bill
The legendary gunfighter James Butler "Wild Bill" Hickok is one of Deadwood's more famous residents. Unfortunately

The Weird West
for him, he's also one of it's more dead residents. He arrived in the Summer of 1876. On August 2, while playing cards at Nutall & Mann's Saloon No. 10, he was shot in the back of the head by Jack McCall.
McCall later explained that he shot Hickok over a poker debt, and further claimed to be the brother of a man Hickok killed back in '69. Rumors ran rampant that McCall was hired to kill Hickok to prevent him from becoming marshal, but none of them were ever proven. McCall was acquitted.
A few days later, Hickok crawled out of his grave, hell bent on revenge. He's Harrowed, and has thus far managed to keep a shaky grip on his manitou's evil tendencies. The first thing he did after waking up from his dirt nap was visit Calamity Jane, who told him of McCall's acquittal.
Now, both Hickok and his manitou are hell-bent on revenge. Hickok's been haunting Jack McCall in an effort to get the man to reveal who hired him, but he's come up empty so far. If McCall doesn't crack soon, Hickok's manitou is liable to resort to more extreme methods.
The Coyote Confederation
Fear Level: 3
The Coyote Confederation was formed in 1874, just a few months after the Battle of Adobe Walls (see page 61). Coyote's own identity is a mystery to folks in the Weird West. Most agree Coyote is male, thanks to his deep booming voice, but they disagree on whether he is Comanche, Cheyenne, Kiowa, or something else. Satanta and Quanah Parker, who do know, aren't talking.
The truth is that Coyote is actually Isatai, the man behind the attack on Adobe Walls in '74. He caught a bullet in the battle, and Parker and Satanta

59
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
carried him to the sacred Black Mesa of Oklahoma to die. He didn't.
Instead, he was visited by a vision of Coyote, the trickster, who informed him that he would live only if he went on to form a new confederation of the People in the trickster's name. Further, Isatai must forever guard his identity. When he asked why, Coyote only hinted at a dire fate that awaited Isatai should he fail.
Today, Isatai hides his face in the hood of a voluminous vermilion cloak.
Raven's Plan
In fact, Isatai's vision was not given to him by Coyote, but by Raven. Knowing that a move for an independent Indian nation would likely lead to bloodshed, Raven does the Reckoners' work in encouraging the fledgling Coyote Confederation. Further, Raven is using Isatai--guiding him through false visions to create even more fear and bloodshed in the region. It was Isatai's visions that led to the current state of

affairs between the Indian nation and the white settlers of Oklahoma.
One day, when tensions have reached a suitable level, Raven plans to assassinate Isatai and take his place, which is why "Coyote" insisted that Isatai conceal his identity. Should the plan succeed, the misguided followers of the duped Isatai will surely bear the brunt of bloody fighting. Atrocity will be met with atrocity and the Reckoners will feed well.

Texas has its fair share of rolling hills, auburn fields, cottonwood stands, and scrub plains, but the stark mountains of New Mexico and Arizona are what really define the area for most travelers.
Wild Texans, Apache raiders, and the constant threat of invasion from Mexico keep the Fear Level simmering nicely. Further adding to the horrific stew is Death himself, who claims this region along with the Great Basin (see page 39). Angry ghosts, chupakabaras, and undead are all common in the area, which tends to sap the moisture--and the life--right out of a body.

Adobe Walls
Fear Level: 3
High in the Texas Panhandle is a ruined village by the name of Adobe Walls. It was built in 1843 by the Bent, St. Vrain & Co. trading company. Bent believed the town would give him an edge on his Indian competition for buffalo hides and stolen horses. The Indians didn't take kindly to this, and sent Bent scurrying Back East with his tail between his legs.
Since then, Adobe Walls has been the site of several conflicts between Indians and whites, most recently in 1874. That last fight left the town in ruins and, according to the Coyote Confederation, haunted. The Indians won't go near the place, and several unfortunate whites have camped there only to turn up dead the next morning.
The truth is that Chief Quanah Parker and his Comanche are the ones keeping Adobe Walls free of visitors. Most white

The Weird West
folks know better than to stay at Adobe Walls these days, but Comanche war bands also use it as a dumping ground for the bodies of buffalo hunters they've caught poaching in Coyote territory.
Tombstone
Fear Level: 3
While the Confederate government claims all of Arizona as its territory, anyone who spends any time near Tombstone knows better. Geronimo and his Chiricahua Apaches dominate the surrounding countryside, and Santa Anna and his New Mexican Army pass through the area frequently on their way to the Maze.
Tombstone was originally founded as a silver mining town, but enjoyed only modest success. The arrival of Bayou Vermilion's railhead, and the subsequent establishment of Tombstone as the destination for Confederate ghost rock

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
caravans from the Great Maze, put it on the map overnight. Suddenly, the town was flooded with a transient population, as well as a horde of merchants, outfitters, and saloon-keepers (and all the other types that make a boomtown boom) looking to part them of their hard-earned cash.
The Maze or Bust!
Many would-be miners are greenhorns from Back East who have heard there's easy money in California. They come to Tombstone by train with little more than the clothes on their back and a pocketful of cash, then spend all that cash outfitting themselves with every conceivable piece of equipment, and wagons and mules to carry it. Needless to say, few of them strike it rich, and their dreams quickly evaporate in the arid Arizona climate.
The country between Tombstone and the Maze is crawling with all sorts of nasty critters and even nastier folks. There's a healthy business for guides out to the Maze, and the few who are worth

a damn usually charge about $50 a head for a safe trip out to the Maze. Those who aren't worth a damn charge $50 anyway, then rob their customers once they're out of sight of Tombstone and bury them somewhere along the Ghost Trail.
The Mule Trains
Every couple of months, a mule train escorted by Confederate soldiers arrives in Tombstone, laden with ghost rock from the Maze. Each caravan includes fifteen to twenty wagons, escorted by two companies of regular troops, usually supplemented by Indian scouts and the occasional armed steamwagon or artillery piece.
Despite this protection, some caravans never reach Tombstone. Some are claimed by Grimme's Guardian Angels (citing divine right) before they ever leave California, others are attacked and destroyed by Apache raiders.
When a caravan does roll in, it's a major event. The soldiers are paid upon safe arrival in Tombstone, and most squander

62
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

a good chunk of their cash blowing off steam in Tombstone's various gambling dens, dance halls, and saloons.
The law in Tombstone--Marshal White and a sole deputy, Spence Walker--isn't really up to the task of keeping a lid on such a volatile melting pot, and the town is rife with crime. The Sheriff of Cochise County, John Behan, doesn't help much. He excels at one part of his job--collecting taxes (of which he's entitled to 10%)--but you can count the number of arrests he's made on one hand.
For obvious reasons, most of Tombstone's population at any given time doesn't maintain a permanent residence, and instead camps in a tent city just outside the town proper. White knows better than to even pretend he's got any kind of pull there, and stays well clear.
The Cowboys
When the Confederates aren't in town, Tombstone belongs to the cowboys. We aren't talking about honest cattle herders here, Marshal, but the Cowboy Gang. The Cowboy Gang is the real law in Tombstone, and the law is whatever happens to be good for the Cowboys. They're a posse of no-good cattlerustling lowlifes.
The movers and shakers in the Cowboy Gang number a little more than a half-dozen. Old Man Clanton runs the gang, and his three sons, Ike, Phineas, and William, ride his coattails. When Old Man Clanton's not around, Curly Bill Brocius calls the shots. John Ringo and Frank and Tom McLaury round out the notables. The Cowboys can usually rustle up 20 to 30 yes-men and hangers-on should the need arise.
The Cowboys occasionally raid the Ghost Trail, but they're too well-known in the region to go to that well too often. Instead, they usually head south of the

The Weird West
border to rustle up some cattle that moo in Spanish.
It's best to stay indoors after the Cowboys return from one of their cattle drives, as their drunken "jollifications" put the Confederate soldiers' to shame. They get dead drunk at Ike's Place (that's a restaurant run by the eldest Clanton brother), then ride around town shooting up the place. Despite numerous complaints, Behan has yet to arrest a single Cowboy. Aside for Behan's general disdain for the law enforcement part of his job, the real problem is that if you take on one Cowboy, you take on the whole gang. Trigger happy posses had better beware.
Unlike most of the Cowboys, Curly Bill Brocius is planning on moving up in the world. He's tired of rustling cattle, and wants to "graduate" to robbing trains and stagecoaches. He knows if he just up and killed Old Man Clanton, half the gang would follow him. It's the half that would backshoot him that worries Brocius.
Instead, he's brokered a deal with Bayou Vermilion to serve as muscle for the railroad. The Cowboys pay attention whenever someone starts asking around about the railroad's operations, and pay an unfriendly "visit"--the kind that

63
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
usually ends in gunfire--to whoever's nosing around.
A Holliday in Tombstone No, not a vacation--not unless you
have a death wish! We're actually talking about John Henry Holliday, better known as "Doc."
The man's had a few run-ins with the Cowboys and lived to tell the tale, which is no mean feat in Tombstone. The Cowboys aren't quite sure how to handle someone who isn't afraid of dying, much less afraid of the Cowboys. They're a bit worried he might make good on his threat and call in his good friend Wyatt Earp to visit Tombstone for a spell.
Doc's a mean shot, a mean card player, and a mean drunk. Cowpokes who know what's good for them pay their dues, play nice, and stay out of his way.

The Epitaph
Tombstone is home to one of the most widely read publications in North America, the Tombstone Epitaph. This rag specializes in ghost stories, monster sightings, conspiracy theories, and other such reports that most folks dismiss as nonsense. But it's entertaining nonsense, and most folks who read it do so for a chuckle and a good scare.
In fact, the Epitaph has a fairly solid record of reporting the truth (about 60% of its stories are at least close to the mark). Those who have been around the Weird West for a while and have seen a thing or two tend to develop a healthy interest in the latest reports of the Epitaph.
If the Epitaph weren't so popular, the Rangers or the Agency would've shut it down long ago. Both organizations are so intent on closing the Epitaph's doors, they'd probably kiss and make up if it meant getting rid of this thorn in their side. Fortunately for the Epitaph, its wide circulation means that any attempt to halt its publication might lend credence to its wild claims. Still, both organizations make it a practice to harass Epitaph reporters and suppress as much of the truth as possible.
Enterprising heroes can make a little extra cash out of their weirder adventures. The Epitaph pays half-a-cent a word for articles, $10 for quality sketches, and $15 and up for photographs. All submissions are subject to independent confirmation, and while the staff of the Epitaph is a credulous bunch, they're no fools.
The lion's share of reports published by the Epitaph are composed by the paper's only staff writer, Lacy O'Malley. Independent submissions are reviewed by the paper's editor, John Clum, who decides on whether to hire an independent consultant (such as the posse) to confirm or deny a story.

64
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

The Texas Rangers
Tombstone gets "civilized" about once a month when Hank Ketchum and his Texas Rangers ride through. That's usually around the time the Cowboys decide they've got business south of the border. Even Lacy O'Malley usually manages to keep his "wild theories" to himself while the Rangers are around. Of course, once they pull out, it doesn't take long for business as usual to resume.
The Apache
The Apache are the predominant Indian tribe in southern Arizona. Raiding and warfare are a way of life for them, and they have gained a welldeserved reputation as fierce warriors. Throughout the 1860s, the tribe proved a fierce opponent for American troops stationed in Arizona. When the Great Quake hit, many of these troops deserted, and there was nothing standing between the Apache and domination of the area.
For a few short months, the Apache were masters of their own destiny, only to have that dream quashed by Confederate troops who arrived to seize

The Weird West
the Arizona territory from the Union deserters. Suddenly, the Apache were again forced to battle for control of their homes.
Worse, the forces of Baron LaCroix have brought their own blight upon the land. Under the leadership of Chief Geronimo, the Apache fight both the Confederate "trespassers" and the evils of the Reckoning.

The Great Rail Wars
Most everyone out West is affected in one way, shape, or form by the so-called "Great Rail Wars." The lucky ones wind up missing a train because it got blown up before it got to them. The unlucky ones were on it.
In any event, the iron horses and the fight to build the transcontinental railroad are important enough to warrant a little more background on the railroads and the Rail Barons who run them.

65
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Bayou Vermilion
Bayou Vermilion is run by a wealthy New Orleans merchant of Haitian descent, Baron Simone LaCroix. The public doesn't know much about the reclusive LaCroix, including where he gets his title. His hermit-like behavior has spawned all sorts of wild stories, including claims that he dabbles in the black arts.
Wild stories being what they are, most are based on little more than rumor and supposition. LaCroix's reputation as a black magician, however, is absolutely true. He's a voodoo master of the first order, and he much prefers dealing with the darker loa--the petro--for his power. Once, LaCroix was little more than a flunky to his sister, a powerful voodoo queen. Ambition quickly won out over blood, however, and he managed to overcome her and assume her power in a bizarre ritual. (He even uses her name--Simone.)
LaCroix cares little for the shipping contracts offered by the North and South as spoils for the victor of the Great Rail Wars, nor indeed does he care much for the success of his railroad. He's in it because the devil made him do it; one of his dark deities ordered him to throw his hat in the ring. The only joy he gets out of the competition is the misery and bloodshed he leaves in the wake of his rail line.
For the record, Marshal, that dark deity we mentioned was actually a powerful manitou in service to the Reckoners. It's manipu lated LaCroix into serving as a spoiler in the race, though the Baron himself is unaware of his status as prize patsy.

In any event, the Baron doesn't really have the financial resources to fight fair with his competitors, but he has one
thing they don't--a labor force that doesn't tire, strike, or rest. Yep, he uses his voodoo magic to raise legions of walkin' dead to lay track for him. Despite his great power, he's been taxed to his limit lately, and the fact that the Apache do everything they can to harry his rail gangs and destroy his unholy workforce doesn't
help. He's extended his railhead as far as the Mojave Desert, but the brutal conditions are slowing down even his tireless undead rail workers.
If Bayou Vermilion manages to win the Rail Wars, it will give the South a significant advantage in any future conflict between the North and South, due largely to the fact that Bayou Vermilion track is laid entirely through Confederate territory.
Black River
Black River is run by Mina Devlin, widow of the railroad's founder, Miles Devlin. These two were like peas in a
pod. That is, if peas could have cold, shriveled hearts and souls as black as midnight six feet under!
For all their ruthlessness, they were quite enamored with each other. So when Miles was assassinated, his bitter widow tracked down his killer. After that, she moved on to those who had ordered his assassination, the executives of the Tennessee Central. She killed them, then bumped off their families just for grins. What happened to the assassin? Rumor has it he's still alive, somewhere beneath

66
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

the Devlin mansion, but he wishes he weren't.
Her thirst for revenge sated, Mina quickly decided to take over Miles' business. To her, the Rail Wars are an opportunity to prove that a woman can be just as ruthless, megalomaniacal, and capable as a man. Mina certainly made the most of that opportunity.
Black River rarely ponies up cash for right-of-way through a town. Mina prefers campaigns of seduction, violence, or intimidation--and sometimes all three at once!
Her gangs are some of the meanest in the Rail Wars. Mina doesn't have the toys of Wasatch, the undead of Bayou Vermilion, or the assets of some of her competitors, but she's got secrets of her own. She has long dabbled in the dark side of witchcraft, and she's one of the most powerful witches in the Weird

The Weird West
West. She's not afraid to pass on her knowledge to the most qualified (as in the most ruthlessly vicious) female employees. You might remember we mentioned the most famous of her rail gangs--the Wichita Witches--in the Player's Guide. We weren't kidding, Marshal, they really are witches, and mighty powerful ones at that. Usually, Mina's got them spread all over the place overseeing her operations, but Mina's gathered them all together on more than one occasion, whether for some black ritual, or simply a lucrative train robbery.
Mina herself is a canny double dealer, and has made and broken alliances with a number of other rail barons over the past several years, including both Bayou Vermilion and Union Blue. Though she's long since dismissed LaCroix as a useless puppet (she's unsure who holds the strings), Joshua Chamberlain

67
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
of Union Blue has sparked her interest. He, to her mind, is a man of vision and, more importantly, resources. He's got the Union Army at his beck and call too, and Mina wants it. Some time ago, Mina attempted to seduce Chamberlain away from his wife, but Chamberlain rebuffed her advances.
Unfortunately for him, she managed to palm several minor possessions on her way out of his private rail car. Thus far, thanks to these acquisitions, she's been able to favorably influence Chamberlain's opinion of her, making him more receptive to a variety of business deals and alliances of convenience. Ultimately, she hopes to turn his heart away from his wife, marry him, kill him, and inherit Union Blue for her own.
Like Bayou Vermilion, Black River is a Southern railroad, though not to the same extent. While Bayou Vermilion track is laid entirely in Confederate Territory, much of Black River's rolling stock travels through disputed lands. Still, Black River's headquarters is in Memphis, Tennessee, which means the Confederate government can apply all sorts of unpleasant pressure should Devlin try to do business with the Union.
Dixie Rails
Once owned in part by Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Dixie Rails was originally conceived as a way to shuttle Southern troops along the American frontier in times of war. With the discovery of ghost rock, however, it joined the other railroads in striving westward, in the hope of scoring a major advantage for the Confederate Government in the long war. Many in the Confederate government saw the same opportunity, and pushed a number of grants,

subsidies, and other considerations for Dixie Rails through the Confederate Congress.
With Lee's death, he willed his stake in Dixie Rails to his nephew, Fitzhugh Lee, who had long managed the railroad's business. For his part, Fitzhugh continues striving to reach the Great Maze, but he is nowhere near the strategist his uncle was. Dixie Rails struggles along at a sluggish pace, and seems the underdog in the Great Rail Wars.
Lately, however, Dixie Rails has resumed the pace it once maintained under the guidance of Robert E. Lee. Fitzhugh seems a driven man, and spends all his waking hours on the business of winning the Great Rail Wars. Furthermore, he now seems gifted with insight heretofore beyond him.
You see, Fitzhugh's seen a ghost. Not just any ghost, but the ghost of his uncle (or at least, that's what it tells him). It cries out for revenge against his Yankee murderers, and advises Fitzhugh on the wisest course of action in his pursuit of victory in the Rail Wars. Under the spirit's guidance, Fitzhugh hasn't put a foot wrong, and he is starting to make great advances for the southern railroad.
In fact, this isn't actually the general's ghost. It's simply a mischievous manitou
intent on causing as much trouble as it can. In this case, it's playing on Fitzhugh's grief for his uncle to drive the man forward in the race for the Maze. If victorious, the younger Lee may very well turn his newfound influence toward pushing the Confederacy once more into war with their northern neighbors.
Just as a by-the-by, Marshal, Lee wasn't actually assassinated by Yankees, nor was the assassin employed by them. He was murdered by Confederate

68
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Colonel Robert Alexander, a pawn of the Reckoners. The story of a Yankee conspiracy is simply part of the manitou's deception.
Unfortunately, that's not the worst the manitou has to offer. It's promised the younger Lee that he--the revered Robert E. Lee--can be with Fizhugh once more, in the flesh. All Fizhugh needs to do is find a way to get Lee's body up and running again. Then the manitou can inhabit it and cause all sorts of trouble for the North and the South.
Iron Dragon
Everyone who lives in the Great Maze fears the colorful sampans of the Warlord Kang. His pirates steal ghost rock from other miners, raiding their camps and making off with their ore-laden barges. He makes a great deal of money shipping his ill-gotten ghost rock to points East--that's Far East, Marshal. The rest of his filthy lucre comes from the opium trade, prostitution, and any other vice he can dip his well-manicured hands into. Needless to say, vice is big business in the Maze.
Kang is a ruthlessly efficient warlord, superior martial artist, and powerful sorcerer, but that's not enough for him. His secret ambition is to establish his own nation--an empire, in his mind--in the northern Maze. To achieve this, he needs money, and lots of it. Piracy and graft are quite lucrative, but not nearly to the degree Kang requires. When the competitions to build a transcontinental railroad were announced, Kang saw his opportunity. He bought out the old Chicago and North Western and quickly extended its lines west.

The Weird West
Kang entered the railroad race later than most, so he had some catching up to do. Worse, all the good routes had already been claimed by his competition, so he was forced to attempt what no one else had been able to manage--to negotiate right-of-way through the Sioux Nations.
Fortunately for Kang, the Sioux had been menaced for some time by creatures that made their home in the famed Devil's Tower in Wyoming. The wicasas made a deal with the warlord: if
he could eliminate the creatures in Devil's Tower, he could build a single rail line through the northern Sioux Nations.
Kang took a band of hand-picked men and women to Devil's Tower, some of whom actually came back alive. When Kang returned, the paha wakansica, or mountain devils, menaced the Sioux no more. Kang had his rightof-way. This really paid off for him with the founding of Deadwood, as he now has the exclusive right to ship men and materiel to and from the treaty city. He takes a share of all the vices Deadwood's inhabitants enjoy. And that's a lot of vice!
Kang figures that what's worked for him once could work again. While every other Rail Baron lays track toward Lost Angels, Kang is working on a deal with a powerful member of the Shan Fan Triad--that's the Chinese mob--to grant him right-of-way into Shan Fan. Though nothing prevents the other Rail Barons from laying track to Shan Fan, most weren't really interested in dealing with foreigners for the right-of-way required for the final stretch. Kang, being Chinese himself, doesn't have that problem, and the triad bosses--notably Thin Noodles Ma (see page 48)--are likely to deal more favorably with Kang.

69
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

Kang didn't go straight to the top when he approached the Shan Fan Triad, as he knows Big Ears Tam is pretty content with the way things are there. One of his lieutenants, however, covets the power held by Tam, and was interested in what Kang had to sell. Thin Noodles Ma now studies black magic under Kang's tutelage, and Kang has promised to deliver the means through which Ma can ascend to Big Bosshood.
Union Blue
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the hero of Gettysburg, is presid ent of the Union Blue Railroad. He was working as Grant's aide de camp when the trans continental competition was announced. Realiz ing its imp ortance to the country, he requested a leave of absence to form Union Blue.
Union Blue runs just south of the Wasatch line while in Union

territory. Chamberlain was forced to build into the Disputed Territories when Wasatch reached the strip of land south of the Sioux Nations first. Previously, he could rely on Union troops to protect his rolling stock in the Disputed Territories, but with the cessation of hostilities he has to hire protection, and his coffers are running low.
Chamberlain's real advantage stems from his personal character. His incredible sense of integrity and honor has won him many friends along his
path, including military commanders and the former leader of the Agency's Western Bureau, the Ghost. This allows him to quickly and cheaply negotiate right-of-ways with towns in both the United States and its territories, as well as in the Disputed Territories.
Unfortunately, one of these ties could also prove to be his

70
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

undoing. The Ghost--also known as Andrew Lane, and more famously as former president Abraham Lincoln--is Harrowed. Only a handful of folks know this, and one of them is Chamberlain. A year or so back, however, the Ghost lost control of his manitou and got up to some evil out West. He eventually regained control, but took himself out of action for a while, hoping to cement his hold over his own body.
The Powers That Be in the Agency decided putting the Ghost back in charge of the North's best weapon against the Reckoning wasn't the wisest thing to do, even if he did seem rehabilitated. Instead, the Ghost volunteered his expertise as a troubleshooter to his old friend Chamberlain.
Without the benefit of Union military protection, Chamberlain can use all the help he can get, so he agreed. But he is entrusting the security of the railr oad to the possessed dead president! If the Ghost can keep his unholy hitchhiker in check, Chamberlain may get the Union Blue clear across the country. If not, it's going to be one Hell of a derailing!
Wasatch
Back when the Rail Wars first got underway, most folks were betting on Darius Hellstromme and his Wasatch Rail Co. to win the whole enchilada. His amazing technology and financial might--Hellstromme is the Weird West's preeminent mad scientist--allowed him to lay track at an astounding rate. What's more, he never had any problems securing right-of-way through the vari ous boomtowns and cities of the West.

The Weird West
Usually, this was because he simply bribed the town's mayor or citizens with piles of cash or a few of his amazing inventions; when that didn't turn the trick, he resorted to terror tactics employing his legions of mechanized monstrosities (along with more mundane mercenaries).
Unfortunately for Hellstromme, he's come up against a wall called the Denver-Pacific Railroad. Owned by his
most prominent scientific rivals, Smith & Robards, the DP runs from Denver all the way to Virginia City, Nevada, the very same territory Hellstromme wishes to run his rail line through. What's more, the DP lines are poised to press on to Lost Angels (from their branch line to Fort 51), Shan Fan, or even to
Sacramento. For a small player in a big struggle, the Denver rails would be a useful addition to a number of lines.

71
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
72
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Originally, Hellstromme and the S&R boys worked out an amicable business arrangement that allowed Wasatch to use DP rolling stock. For a brief time it seemed the great technological rivals were forging some kind of monopoly. That state of affairs didn't last, however (some say Smith was against it all along), and in a spectacular bust up, DP dumped Wasatch stock off their trains in the middle of the desert. No one knows what the cause of the aggravation was, but the only thing more surprising than S&R passing up a chance at a profit was Hellstromme's reaction.
Instead of launching an all-out war (his usual bargaining strategy), Hellstromme tendered a series of gener ous buyout offers, and never mentioned the hundreds of thousands of dollars of machinery that was destroyed in the incident. Rumor has it that Hellstromme's calm response has S&R more rattled than if he'd brought down the thunder. They're ready for anything, but Smith & Robards aren't selling or surrendering.
Had the work begun years ago, Wasatch could have laid track around the DP line, but the railroad is now hemmed in by Union Blue to the south and the Sioux Nations to the north.
Instead, Hellstromme put his enor mous intellect to work and invented an enormous drilling machine with which he intends to burrow beneath the Rocky Mountains and emerge clear of the DP line. He hasn't named the thing--he doesn't really go in for the crazy gadget appellations his contemporaries tend toward--but the crews that work on it call it the "Hellbore" thanks to the

The Weird West
tremendous racket sent up by the enormous amounts of ghost rock the thing burns, a cacophony only amplified by the confined spaces in which the machine operates.
Thus far the Hellbore has vanished into the Rockies along with the rail crews following behind it. A heavily-armed camp (fondly referred to as Camp Hades by its inhabitants) keeps looky-Lous from finding out what's going on. Some speculate it's almost out of the Rockies. Other say it's broken down. A few rumors have even surfaced saying it tunneled straight to Hell, and Hellstromme has gone to meet his maker!
Peace in Our Time?
Ironically, Hellstromme winning the Rail Wars is likely the best possible result for most folks. He's more than happy to accept the ghost rock shipping contract from both the North and the South, and is in prime position to do so, as his line is the only one headquartered in an independent nation.
With neither the Union nor the Confed eracy able to establish a clear advantage in ghost rock powered armament thanks to this balance of power, the Civil War would be less likely to resume.
That said, Hellstromme is the servitor of Pestilence. So, while his victory in the Rail Wars would undoubtedly put a damper on future hostilities in the Civil War, and would bring the bloody feuding of the Rail Barons to an end, he has nefarious plans of his own that could result in even more bloodshed and horror.

Encounters

You know the history, you know the countless plots and schemes the major players have up their sleeves, and your players are scratching their itchy trigger fingers.
As your posse gets ready to saddle up and ride out, it's time to give some consideration to the critters they're going to meet on their wanderings. Some are humans more monstrous than the foulest abomination, some are weird, and others are just plain evil.

In this chapter you'll find plenty of nasty varmints, all of them ready to jump on some tasty sodbusters and tear 'em limb from limb. But just because they're all statted and ready doesn't mean you should necessarily do it, Marshal. Not at first, anyway.
It's easy to make players roll Guts and tell them how terrified they are when they fail. What's a little more challenging is making your jaded, seen-it-all-andthen-some role-players feel a little of that dread themselves. You've got to let them use their imagination.
In other words, wait a little bit before the beastie jumps out of the tall grass and bites down on some poor cowpoke's head. Describe the whispering of the wind through the grass, and the way the clouds cast malformed shadows on the earth. Create a little tension.
Creepy Critters
All the abominations, humans, ani mals, and Famous Folks on the following pages are ready to be used right out of the box, so to speak. That said, you should alter them whenever the mood strikes. You can create variations on

existing creatures to surprise your posse or just to suit your preferences.
A river leviathan could just as easily be a sewage leviathan, if you found yourself in need of such a critter. Any given devil bat, ghoul, or giant shark might be a Wild Card if it suits the particular tale you're telling. Try giving a creature that typically isn't so crafty a sizeable boost to its Smarts, and watch your heroes squirm. "What do you mean they cut the telegraph? They're just critters!"
Animate Hand
This abomination is born after a human hand is severed by some means, preferably one that makes it worthwhile for the hand to seek vengeance. The Reckoners then provide the missing member a disgusting life of its own. The things skitter along using their fingers and thumbs, and can even sit up on their stumps to manipulate other objects (they're rather fond of knives, actually). The hand always has a specific intended victim, but it doesn't mind harassing and terrorizing anyone who gets in its way. It loves to ridicule and tease its victims before closing in for the kill. A hand sometimes bears some identifying

Encounter Difficulties

You might be wondering about the difficulty of the encounters listed throughout this book. Are they intended for characters of Novice Rank? Seasoned?
The answer is none of the above. The encounters are created to reflect the natural (or in some cases unnatural) organization of the characters or creatures listed. That means your group had best be warned that this isn't like certain other games that automatically set the challenge level to something they can deal with. Sometimes a horrific abomination simply needs to be avoided, or clever tactics or hired guns employed to defeat it.
We do this both because it's more natural and it's more of a challenge. Besides, any system we create would have a difficult time fitting the nature of your posse. If a big game hunter hires on a squad of expert riflemen to cover his back, it doesn't make sense that suddenly every rattler has four

buddies as well. That means that just as in real life, exploring the world with a larger party is safer (though it might not fit your posse's plans to keep a low profile). Of course, it also means the heroes have to feed the Extras and provide food, water, and ammo for them as well. And don't forget some of these apples are no doubt rotten.
All that said, the Marshal should tweak encounters to fit the nature of his party. You'll have a good handle on what your party can manage after a few sessions, without the need for some sort of formula.
One thing worth remembering is that a Wild Card creature is signifi cantly more deadly than a non-Wild Card version. Wild Cards are marked throughout the chapter with the Marshal badge icon before the crea ture's name, like this:

Automaton
Automatons are roughly humanoid in shape, consisting of a large torso (housing a ghost rock boiler), pistondriven limbs, and a brassy, cylindrical head. One arm ends in a pincer-like claw while the other terminates in a Gatling gun or flamethrower attached at the elbow.
Dr. Darius Hellstromme builds these mechanical abominations in the City o' Gloom and deploys them all over the Weird West to protect his various interests.
The key to the automatons' intelligence, and therefore their independence, is the construction process. Hellstromme invented a process by which he can reanimate dead brain tissue, and he uses this procedure to create automaton brains. Essentially, automatons are heavily armored walkin' dead forced to obey Hellstromme's orders.
Hellstromme has no desire to see the inner workings of his invention exposed. Each automaton is wired with a powerful explosive that destroys the brain and most of the device's internal parts should the automaton cease functioning.
These metal monsters never surrender. They mow down their opponents with Gatling fire and crush them with their powerful pincers.

Aztec Mummy
During certain periods of their history, the Aztecs practiced a form of mummification, particularly for those who were considered especially blessed or important. Occasionally, one of these mummies--usually that of a mighty king or priest--returns to the world of the living. These revenants usually inhabit ruins or other areas tied to their past, and often attract cults of human followers.
This type of mummy has a specific upkeep requirement. Every 20 days, it must obtain a new heart, fresh from a live human being.
The appearance of an Aztec mummy varies according to the freshness of its heart. With a new heart, the mummy is similar to a Harrowed--only detectable as undead with some effort. As the heart weakens, the mummy's skin begins to dry and tighten, until, on the last day, it becomes little more than a dried-up, withered bag of walking bones.

E nc ou n t e r s
Some Aztec mummies are buried with a small jade stone under their tongues. These stones protect the mummy from all forms of attack while in place.

Black Regiment
The Black Regiment consists of reanimated soldiers slain on both sides of the War Between the States, their uniforms stained black by their own blood. The only members of the unit

79
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
who seem to have any individuality are the Lt. Colonel and the Bugler, whose horn sounds a bloodcurdling charge.
During critical battles between the Blue and Gray, the Black Regiment would sometimes appear to tilt the battle in favor of the loser, solely in the interest of sustaining further bloodshed. With the war over, the Regiment now targets units that become lax in their discipline, no matter where in the Weird West they might be found.
The undead of the Black Regiment prefer to fight viciously rather than effectively, favoring charges with their rusty bayonets. They attack their enemies mercilessly, but do not act in any way to protect their "allies."

Bloodwire
Related to tumblebleeds, this thorny, vine-like abomination is nigh indis ting uishable from barbed wire. It camouflages itself along barbed wire fences, until prey approaches, then lashes out, wrapping itself around its victim and draining his blood through its thorny tendrils. Following its meal, the engorged bloodwire resembles a fat, red milkweed and slowly slithers along the fence to lay a new ambush. Bloodwire is to blame for many range wars, as gunmen employed by opposing cattle barons assume their counterparts are

81
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
responsible for the bloodwire's victims. The wounds inflicted by bloodwire resemble small-caliber gunshot wounds.

· Whip Thin: Bloodwires are difficult to hit thanks to their peculiar dimensions, and all attack rolls targeting bloodwires suffer a ­4 penalty.
Bloody One
Priests of the Cult of Lost Angels are sometimes granted enchanted bone fragments taken from their victims. Grimme gifts them with a twisted miracle that summons forth a bloody zombie with putrefying organs, which looks much as Grimme did during his rebirth. These blood-soaked skeletons are called bloody ones.
A cultist need only toss such a bone fragment on the ground to summon the horrid servant. The bloody one follows its summoner's orders to the letter, but only if he is a flesh-eating member of Grimme's cannibal cult. Anyone else is attacked on sight.
Bloody ones do not speak, but some times emit a slurpy laugh. Usually, it's at the prospect of a nice meal of human flesh.

Bogie Man
The bogie man is a spindly abomination made of dried twigs and sticks, with a dry tumbleweed for a head. Once a creature of children's nightmares, this horror was given unholy life by the Reckoners. It takes special joy in frightening young children, whose elders rarely believe their tales. The bogie man is careful not to let adults see him, and it goes out of its way to make sure children witness its cruel and deadly mischief. If it can frame some poor child for the deed, so much the better.

· Claws: Str+d4.
· Childhood Terror (­2): Anyone with the Young Hindrance must make a Guts roll (­2) when they encounter a bogie man.

82
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

· Fear: Anyone who encounters a bogie man must make a Guts roll.
· Unbelievable: No one believes in the bogie man, even in the Weird West. Extras who have yet to encounter this critter are treated as having the Doubting Thomas Hindrance when the bogie man is encountered.
· Weakness (Children): Anyone with the Young Hindrance who strikes a bogie man with a Fighting roll and causes at least one wound destroys the creature instantly.
· Coup: A Harrowed who kills the bogie man gains an immediate die type increase to his Stealth skill (or gains it at d4 if he did not have it before), as well as a +2 bonus to Intimidation rolls against anyone with the Young Hindrance. On the flip side, the Harrowed suffers +2 damage from attacks made by those with the Young Hindrance.
Bone Fiend
The "heart" (so to speak) of a bone fiend is a human skull, colored as black as pitch. Bone fiends are created when a manitou finds a human skull with at least a little bit of brain matter left, and binds nearby bones and cartilage into a massive abomination.
The creature varies in appearance due to its ability to add additional bones to its mass, and can have up to six legs and

E nc ou n t e r s
as many as four arms provided enough bones are nearby. The lair of any bone fiend is always knee-deep in spare parts, which allows it to use its abilities to the fullest. It goes to great lengths to protect its black skull, which it usually hides within a tightly packed mass of bone in its torso. Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d8, Spirit d12, Strength d10, Vigor d8 Skills: Fighting d12, Notice d6 Pace: 8; Parry: 8; Toughness: 11 Special Abilities: · Bite/Claws: Str+d4. · Bone Explosion: The bone fiend can
cause itself to explode, hurling its bones outward like shrapnel. This inflicts 2d6 damage to everyone under a Medium Burst Template centered on the bone fiend. The bone fiend must spend one full round reforming, during which time it can take no action, and its skull loses the benefit of its increased Size. · Fear (­1): Bone fiends cause Guts rolls (­1) for any who encounter them.

83
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
· Fleet-Footed: Bone fiends have a d10 running die.

· Improved Sweep: The fiend's attacks hit all adjacent foes with no penalty.
· Invulnerability: Bone fiends can be put down, blown up, or otherwise destroyed, but reform 1d4 rounds later as long as a ready supply of bones remains. The only way to kill a bone fiend is to destroy its ebon skull (see Weakness).
· Size +3: The fiends are around 8' tall.
· Undead: +2 Toughness. +2 to recover from being Shaken. Called shots do no extra damage.
· Weakness (Ebon Skull): A single wound to the skull (Toughness 8) destroys a Bone Fiend. Called shots to the skull are treated like called shots to the head, and inflict normal

damage (though do not gain the usual +4 to damage).
Braincrawler
A braincrawler is a dark-colored, multi-legged, parasitic abomination about six inches in length. It resembles an enormous centipede. It attacks by burrowing into its victim's neck and latching on to his spinal cord.
Once attached, the braincrawler sends horrific images straight into the host's mind and sustains itself through his terror. The critter isn't very smart, and its host doesn't talk except for the occasional one-syllable word.
Further, when a braincrawler takes control, its host undergoes several physical changes. First, the victim's eyes turn solid black, reflecting the spiritual evil of the braincrawler. Second, because the critter is leeching off the host's

84
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

nervous system, it increases his pain tolerance. Finally, since the parasite has different tastes, the victim isn't very picky about what he eats. Insects, worms, carrion, and human flesh are all considered tasty treats.
Braincrawlers always strike while their potential victim sleeps. These critters also prefer victims who live hermit-like existences, since they have little fear of discovery in such remote environs. That said, entire settlements have fallen prey to these insidious creatures.
Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4, Spirit d12, Strength d4, Vigor d4
Skills: Fighting d6, Knowledge (Local Area) d4, Notice d8, Stealth d6, Tracking d10
Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 2
Special Abilities:
· Fearless: Braincrawlers are immune to Fear and Intimidation.
· Parasite: A braincrawler attacks by burrowing into the back of its victim's neck as he sleeps. This is automatically successful unless the victim is awake, in which case the braincrawler must roll a raise on a Fighting roll. Each day thereafter the victim must make an opposed Spirit roll to remain in control of his own body. Failure means the braincrawler gains complete dominance. While in control the braincrawler uses its own Smarts and Spirit, but otherwise uses the traits of the victim. Once the braincrawler is fully in control, its victim cannot be Shaken, although he can be wounded normally. If a braincrawler occupies a Wild Card, it loses the benefit of the Wild Die but retains the three wounds allowed Wild Cards.
· Size ­2: Braincrawlers are small creatures.

E nc ou n t e r s
· Small: Attack rolls targeting braincrawlers suffer a ­2 penalty.
· Wild Card: Braincrawlers only gain Wild Card status when they possess a Wild Card host.
· Weakness (Alcohol, Fire): A braincrawler can be removed by dousing its fleshy burrow with 100 proof alcohol, or failing that, by burning the area with an open flame. In either case, the braincrawler must make a Spirit roll (­4) each round or flee the victim's body. The fleeing braincrawler does 1d4 damage to the host for each week or portion thereof it was attached to the host's spine. If this damage Incapacitates the victim, he does not roll on the Injury table, but instead suffers brain damage (lowering his Smarts by one die type).
Canker
Cankers are easily mistaken for a prairie ticks, though they're much more insidious. They begin their horrible lives inside the human body. The creature's chitinous body starts out small--about the size of a chicken's egg--but grows quickly, reaching feelers and proboscis into the recesses of the host body to gain nourishment. After a month within a host, a canker has completely consumed the host's internal organs and its appendages are large and strong enough to stretch into the host's arms and legs and operate them. The canker leaves just enough of the victim's original mind intact so he's aware of his horrific situation. It doesn't take long for a canker to mimic its host, but it is nothing more than a sophisticated (and disgusting) parrot. It doesn't adapt well to new situations, but still possesses a fierce, animal cunning.

Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 5 (1)
Special Abilities:
· Armor +1: Hard shell.
· Claws: Str+d4.
· Fear: Anyone viewing a canker must make a Guts roll.
· Meat Puppet: A canker deposits its eggs through a tube down the throat of sleeping or bound victims, who must make a Vigor roll every day or be consumed by the growing canker within. So long as the potential host continues to make this roll, the canker can still be removed through surgery. This requires a Healing roll (­4), which saves the victim's life but leaves him busted up inside (he loses one Vigor die type). Once it gains control, the canker has full use of the body and manipulates it like a puppet. While the victim still technically lives, he cannot survive the removal of the canker. Cankers can mimic, and therefore use, any skill or Edge possessed by the victim, with the exception of arcane skills. If a canker's host is Incapacitated, the hideous creature bursts out in a shower of gore and scrambles off into the night.
· Reproduction: If a canker manages to subdue a foe in its web, it may spend three rounds laying an egg in the poor soul. If the victim manages to escape the web before the process is complete, the canker withdraws into its original host.
· Size ­1: When fully grown, cankers are the size of large dogs.

· Webs: This critter can spin small webs through the mouth of its victim, enveloping unsuspecting (usually sleeping) targets taking two rounds. Once bound, the victim must make a Strength roll to break free. Another character may spend one round removing the web without a roll.
· Wild Card: Cankers only gain Wild Card status when they have grown within a Wild Card host.
Carcajou
A carcajou is a nightmarish wolverinelike creature, roughly three feet tall. Its muzzle holds two rows of triangular, serrated teeth and its paws are tipped by three-inch long claws capable of scoring stone. The monster's fur is dark brown, shot through with lighter coloring around its muzzle. Its eyes are large, with oddly shaped and disturbingly human irises.
The carcajou is ferocious and ravenously hungry at all times. It preys on any animal, and can even wipe out small herds of cattle that wander too near its lair. Carcajou often strip trap lines (and, on occasion, their unlucky owners)

86
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

and once it sets up housekeeping in a new lair, it quickly drives away all other animal life.
In order to conserve its energy, carcajou hide under rocky overhangs or fallen logs near game trails and water holes. They lunge at their prey in a whirlwind of fangs and fur, and usually make short work of any animal up to and including full-grown bears.

· Improved Frenzy: The creature makes two Fighting attacks at no penalty.
· Quick: Carcajous discard action cards of 5 or lower.
· Size ­1: A carcajou is about the size of a large dog.
Catamount
The catamount is a large wildcat that is nearly impossible to spot thanks to its chameleon­ like fur. It often conceals itself

E nc ou n t e r s
in trees, sometimes hooking its rear claws onto a branch and swinging down on unsuspecting prey. In addition, it is an uncanny mimic, and often imitates human screams or even cries for help.
As intelligent as a cowpoke and twice as big, the catamount is a fearsome abomination. It stalks hunters and often turns their own traps against them. Catamounts are found primarily in the major mountain ranges of the West: the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Wasatch, and Rockies.

· Quick: The creature discards Action Cards of 5 or less.
· Size +2: Catamounts are ten feet long.
Cemetery Wolf
Cemetery wolves are named for their propensity for digging up human corpses for their carrion feasts. The beasts have no fur on their muzzles and possess long, rock hard claws that are ideal for digging. Wicked canine teeth and near-human cunning complete the awful package.
Cemetery wolves appear in small packs wherever hastily dug graves are found. In other words, they're pretty much everywhere these days. They communicate with one another by laughing--yipping barks that raise a man's hackles. These critters are bigger than coyotes and have a dark stripe along their spines and dark spots on their flanks.
Cemetery wolves do not always wait. Often, when a battle is ended, the wolves begin feasting on the corpses while the dying look on in horror and wait their turn.

Chinook
The chinook is a massive beast that resembles a giant wolverine with gray and brown markings. It possesses large claws that allow it to move easily over snow or through mud. Its rather colorful name comes from the warm wind that

88
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

causes early thaws in the Northwest Territory. Like the warm wind, the chinook represents a dangerous change in local patterns. The beast hibernates in summer, but emerges from its slumber in the late fall. The predator is a dedicated carnivore, and its massive size and appetite enable it to hunt any and all creatures found in the Pacific Northwest--especially humans.

· Weather Control: A chinook can alter the surrounding weather conditions to induce blizzards or heat waves, regardless of the prevailing weather conditions. Anyone caught within a one-mile radius of the chinook must make an immediate Vigor roll to avoid gaining a Fatigue level from either cold or heat, and must make further rolls as would normally be required (donning appropriate dress negates this). The change in weather lasts 1d4 days.
Chupakabara
This abomination is a small gray or brown creature with a vaguely monkeylike appearance, a large head, long arms, and short legs. Its hands and feet end in vicious claws, and it has a round mouth filled with jagged teeth. Chupakabara are nocturnal, and their large, round, milky black eyes provide excellent night vision. A chupakabara (Spanish for "goat-sucker") is produced when the Reckoners take note of one who willingly

E nc ou n t e r s
betrays a family member. Chupakabaras feed on the blood of animals (usually domesticated beasts like goats), and like to get the Drop on their prey. Besides drinking blood, the chupakabara also likes eating the soft, tasty bits of critters, such as eyes and lips, and can also reach its long arms down a critter's throat to pick out other "delicacies."

· Trackless: This critter never leaves a trail, and Tracking rolls attempted to follow it automatically fail.
· Unseen Movement: While running, the chupakabara becomes blurred and hard to see. Anyone who interrupts the monster to attack it while it is running suffers a ­2 modifier on his attack roll.
· Coup: Harrowed who defeat a chupa kabara gain its Trackless ability. Sadly for the Harrowed, he can't turn this ability off, which may lead to some unfortunate questions.
Clockwork Tarantula
Clockwork tarantulas stand about 3' high and resemble enormous, mechanical versions of their namesakes. Eight gear-driven legs, each over a yard long, emerge from the bulbous, armorplated body. Within this hard steel carapace are the pistons and devices that give the creature "life." The head contains a set of sharpened, hollow tubes that function as the mechanism's primary weapons, or "fangs."
These are another of Hellstromme's devices, designed to give his rail gangs an edge in the fight for the first transcontinental line. Like automatons, the duplication of these machines is beyond the ken of most inventors, and for the same reason. Clockwork tarantulas, however, don't rate human brains. Instead, they're guided by reanimated animal brains.
The mechanical arachnids are terrifying opponents, made more so by the potent acid they inject or spray at targets. Should a clockwork tarantula be defeated, its remaining acid is released to destroy the creature, concealing the method of its construction forever. Their metal plating makes them somewhat resistant to normal firearms. Just like

automatons, these devices are absolutely fearless and fight accordingly.

· Wall Crawling: A clockwork tarantula may climb vertical surfaces at its full Pace and move across inverted surfaces at half Pace.
· Weakness (Head): Shots and other attacks which target an clockwork tarantula's head do normal damage.
Demon
The Weird West is chock full of fire and brimstone preachers who harangue their congregations with worries of Hell and damnation. The Reckoners are loathe to let such a ready source of fear fall by the wayside, and occasionally reward a Satanic cult--or torture a God­fearing congregation--with something straight out of the most zealous preacher's worst imaginings.

E nc ou n t e r s

Demons draw much of their form from the concepts of the summoning cult or the frightened congregation. As a result, they vary greatly in appearance, size, and power. Most conform very closely to the most common depictions of demonic beings. Additionally, most demons play the appropriate role in any Faustian bargain a cultist might propose, though any power granted comes straight from the Reckoners. The demon is nothing more than a Hellish broker.
Whenever cultists "summon" a demon, they go through a series of complex rituals, possibly including human or animal sacrifice. The more horrific the ritual, the larger and more powerful the demon bestowed upon them as a reward. The demon, however, is in no way bound

to the summoners, no matter what these misguided souls might believe. Once the cult is of no further use, the demon discards them in the most frightening fashion available.
On the rare occasions when demons are forced into direct physical confrontations, they take full advantage of their immunity to most attacks and rend their foes to shreds with their claws and teeth.

Desert Thing
Desert things are loathsome horrors lurking beneath the soft sands of the southwestern deserts. Desert things move very slowly beneath the dunes, setting up shop along popular trails or in or near a water hole. When a hapless traveler passes by, the thing grabs its legs or hooves with its long tentacles and drags it into its circular maw.
Desert things can sense approaching prey up to 25" (50 yards) distant with a Notice roll (opposed by Stealth if the posse's being sneaky). When

the prey gets within reach of its 5" long tentacles, the creature attacks.
Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d4, Strength d12+2, Vigor d12
Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d6, Stealth d12+2
Pace: 2; Parry: 6; Toughness: 15 (2)/9 (7)
Special Abilities:
· Armor: +2 for the body submerged in the sand, +7 on the creature's tentacles.
· Bite: Str+d10, AP 3.
· Drag: On a successful opposed Strength check the desert thing drags its prey 1" closer to its maw. Each raise on this roll increases the distance dragged by 1". If the victim beats the desert thing with a raise, he manages to break free from the tentacle.
· Improved Sweep: The desert thing may attack up to 8 opponents with a Reach of 5" at no penalty. Each tentacle has a Toughness of 9, and is severed if "wounded."

92
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

· Size +5: The enormous bulk of the desert thing is hidden beneath the sand.
Devil Bat
These critters live in the Badlands of the Dakota Territory. The Sioux call them kinyan tiwicakte, or "flying murderer."
Devil bats are nocturnal predators who hunt in packs. They attack by hurtling from the night and grabbing prey with their taloned feet. If the bat thing is successful, it races into the air and drops its prey from the apex of its swoop, hoping to dash it to death on the rocks below. The things then settle down to devour the victim, whether he is dead or merely stunned.
Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d8 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d12+1, Vigor d8
Skills: Fighting d10, Intimidation d10, Notice d8, Stealth d12+2
Pace: 4; Parry: 7; Toughness: 6
Special Abilities:
· Claws: Str+d4.
· Death from Above: A flying devil bat that hits with a raise causes damage as usual. In addition, the thing grasps its prey in its claws and swoops into the air, moving the remainder of its flight Pace. The next round the creature drops its prey to the ground (see falling damage in Savage Worlds). Characters on Hold or who have not yet taken their action may attempt to hold on by making an opposed Strength roll. If successful, the prey continues to struggle. With a raise, the victim forces the creature close enough to a landing spot to jump free without taking damage.
· Flight: Pace 16.
· Quick: Devil bats discard action cards of 5 or lower.

E nc ou n t e r s
· Weakness (Stillness): Devil bats see by sonar. They must subtract 4 from their attack rolls if their prey stands stock still (assuming they detected it before the victims "froze"). Standing still when a devil bat is sweeping down on you requires a Guts check at ­2. Failure means the victim flinches or moves, allowing the bats to "see" him.
Devil Ray
Devil rays are 15' wide manta rays with bony tail spikes. The creatures have pitch-black skin, small black eyes on their leading edge, and a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth on their underside. Two small, knobby projections jut from above their eyes, giving the impression of horns.
Devil rays swim quickly enough to launch themselves into the air, allowing them to glide more than 10 feet above the water's surface. They usually use

93
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
this ability to sweep boat decks clear of potential meals. These abominations are found only in saltwater and travel in schools of 10 or more. Devil rays are the cause of many of the "ghost ships" that turn up in the Maze.

Pace: 0; Parry: 6; Toughness: 7
Special Abilities:
· Aquatic: Pace 12.
· Bite: Str+d4.
· Fleet-Footed: Devil rays roll a d10 when running.
· Glide: Devil rays may fly for one turn if they "ran" in the water the previous turn. They may achieve a height of up to 4" and glide a distance of up to 12" and may make an attack at any point during the glide.
· Grapple: A devil ray may make a grapple attack by engulfing a target with its wings. If successful, it may make a bite attack each round until the grapple is broken. Characters dragged into the water must succeed at a Vigor roll every round or start to drown (see Savage Worlds rules).
· Size +2: Devil rays are 15' wide rays.
· Tail Spike: Str+d4, may attack to the rear only.
Dread Wolf
Dread wolves have blood-red eyes, and they constantly drool bloody saliva that coats their fur with gore. Their ferocious appearance is accentuated by the strong stench of carrion that clings to their mangy pelts. The smell and sight of a dread wolf

causes normal animals to flee, and it doesn't do much good for people either.
These creatures, sometimes called blood wolves or banshee wolves, are created whenever a pack of normal wolves consumes the flesh of a supernatural corpse. The corrupted flesh transforms the wolves into servants of the Reckoners, infecting them with an unnatural form of rabies known as "bad blood."
Despite their appearance, dread wolves act much like normal wolves, traveling in packs looking for lone stragglers and other easy prey.
Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d10
Skills: Fighting d8, Guts d8, Intimidation d10, Notice d6
Pace: 10; Parry: 6; Toughness: 7
Special Abilities:
· Bite: Str+d6.
· Fleet-Footed: Dread wolves have a d10 running die.
· Go for the Throat: Dread wolves, instinctively go for an opponent's soft spots. When a dread wolf rolls a raise

94
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

on its attack roll, it hits the target's leastarmored location.
· Howl: Dread may take an action to make an Intimidation Test of Will against anyone within earshot of their fearsome howl.
· Infection: Anyone wounded from the bite of a dread wolf risks infection. A Vigor roll must be made to avoid sickness. In animals, this sickness manifests itself as a constant Berserk state (as the Edge). Humans gain the Bloodthirsty, Habit (Major, Cannibalism), and Mean Hindrances. Infection can only be cured if the Habit is bought off (see the Habit Hindrance).
Dust Devil
Dust devils are vicious killers that lurk in the deserts of the southwest. When they spy prey, they create a whirlwind about themselves and move in for the kill.
Dust devils attack by centering on their prey and whirling around it with their spiny, serpentine bodies. They attack from the center of their dirt-filled whirlwinds, making them difficult to see or hit with normal weapons.
Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d4, Strength d12+2, Vigor d8
Skills: Fighting d12, Notice d8
Pace: 12; Parry: 8; Toughness: 6
Special Abilities:
· Deflection: Attacks aimed at the skeletal serpent within the whirlwind suffer a ­2 modifier for its thin size

E nc ou n t e r s
and rapid movement. Ranged attacks that miss with a 1 on the skill die are deflected and spit out in a random direction, and strike the first target in that direction as if he were an innocent bystander. · Whirlwind: The dust devil is the size of a Medium Burst Template. Everything inside or adjacent to the template is attacked by the whipping spines of the thing and automatically suffers Str damage. Those who are actually inside the template are blind as well (­4 to most actions), unless they wear goggles of some sort. · Coup: A Harrowed who absorbs a dust devil's essence gains +2 Pace.
Duster
Dusters appear as scrawny, emaciated rabbits, or some other critter that blends in extremely well with their surroundings. In the Weird West, looks can be deceiving, and the duster is no exception. Per ounce, they're the cutest little killers in the Weird West.
These critters live only in the most inhospitable and arid of places, where

95
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

they wait for unwitting travelers to look in their sad little eyes and invite them into their hearts and other organs. They live by sucking the water out of other living beings. Those who live to tell of encounters with them believe the desert wouldn't be dry if it wasn't for these malevolent furballs.
Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d4, Vigor d6
Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d6, Notice d10, Persuasion d12, Stealth d10, Tracking d10
Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 3
Special Abilities:
· Alertness: A duster gains +2 bonus to all Notice rolls.
· Quick: Dusters discard Action Cards of 5 or lower.
· Size ­2: Dusters are typical small animals such as rabbits.
· Small: Anyone attacking a duster must subtract 2 from his attack rolls.
· Water Drain: When a duster makes a touch attack in combat, it can drain

moisture from the victim. Make an opposed Notice roll between the duster and its target. If the opponent loses, he gains one Fatigue level from thirst. Anyone who dies from this Fatigue loss is left a dried, mummified husk. This ability can also be used to drain the ambient moisture from the air, evaporating up to 4 quarts of water in an hour. Harrowed are not affected by this ability.
· Water Sense: A duster can sense water within one mile of its location, and may make a Tracking roll to locate the source.
· Weakness (Water): Oddly enough, dusters are very vulnerable to water. To a duster water is like fire, and inflicts 2d4 damage when splashed on it. Immersion in water kills the thing instantly.
Flesh Jacket
Without a host, the flesh jacket is a slithering mass of human skin. The skin appears largely intact, save for the slit up

96
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

the middle of the back and the absence of all skin above the neckline. Flesh jackets are fashioned by very powerful, very evil cults. To create one, a black magician with the proper knowledge removes the skin from a willing cultist, and imbues the shorn hide with a will of its own.
While the flesh jacket can keep a corpse moving indefinitely, the creature attempts to find a new host as soon as possible. Hauling around a carcass is no easy task, after all. It is possible--though difficult--to kill just the flesh jacket without harming its host if the host is subdued first.
Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4, Spirit d8, Strength d4, Vigor d4
Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d8, Notice d6
Pace: 2; Parry: 5; Toughness: 4
Special Abilities:
· Damage Sharing: All damage done to a host wearing a flesh jacket is divided equally between the host and flesh jacket. A flesh jacket cannot be Shaken while on its host.
· Fear (­1): A flesh jacket on the move without its host causes a Guts roll (­1).
· Hardy: Flesh jackets are very hard to kill and do not take wounds from

E nc ou n t e r s
multiple Shaken results. It requires an actual wound to put a flesh jacket down, though its host benefits from no such protection.
· Parasite: Once a flesh jacket has enveloped its prey by scoring a raise on a grapple roll, the host must make a Spirit roll to avoid being taken over by the jacket. After it's in control, the monster can use any skill the victim has, and uses the victim's physical attributes at one die type higher than normal. The victim of a flesh jacket must consume an enormous amount of food to satisfy the hunger of both (twice the usual amount). Any time the host would suffer a level of Fatigue from hunger, the flesh jacket feeds upon him instead, inflicting a wound that cannot be negated.
· Wall Crawling: Hostless flesh jackets can crawl along ceilings and walls at their normal Pace. They prefer to fall onto victims from above (usually giving them the Drop).
· Wild Card: Flesh jackets gain Wild Card status when they control a Wild Card host.

Gabriel Hound
Gabriel hounds (also called gabbe brecht or barghests) are associated with witches, werewolves, or other shape-changing humans. The large, black dogs resemble mastiffs with red sparks in their pupils and low growls rolling from their throats.
Gabriel hounds are almost always encountered as the forerunner of some more powerful evil. Although others may see it, only the creature's target is cursed by its power. The hounds seldom attack outright. If they do, they begin with a blood-chilling howl and follow up with their formidable fangs.
Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d8, Spirit d12, Strength d8, Vigor d10

Gaki
The gaki is a powerful abomination, not a form of undead as legends suggest. It does, however, have the ability to turn itself into a tiger-like monster or impersonate others. These monsters are sometimes found near isolated graveyards and they aren't above graverobbing to sate their hunger.
In its normal form, the gaki appears like a decaying emaciated corpse. However it uses this form only to startle its victims before attacking; due to its shapechange abilities, it usually chooses a normal human appearance.
The creature may hunt in animal form or use its disguise ability to lure in unsuspecting victims by appearing as an attractive member of the opposite sex. After it has feasted on a victim it may use their appearance as a lure to capture others, but it has no knowledge of the person's memories or personalities. It can only mimic the physical form.

· Weakness (Blessed Weapons): A gaki takes full damage from a sword blessed by a Shinto or Buddhist priest.
Ghost
Ghosts come in a wide variety of types. Poltergeists tend to throw things, shades haunt particular families or places, and phantoms are frenzied killers.
Exactly what powers your ghost has are up to you, but here are the details on the most common.

Such spirits may not travel more than a mile from the anchor, though if it moves, they go with it.
· Chill of the Grave: A ghost may make a touch attack that deals 2d6 nonlethal damage. Only magic armor protects against this damage.
· Ethereal: The creature is immaterial and cannot be harmed by normal weapons. Magic and magical items affect them normally.

E nc ou n t e r s
· Invisible: Ghosts are invisible, but can become visible at will (usually to cause Fear). Attacks against an invisible target--assuming someone even knows the spirit is present--are made at ­6.
· Nightmares: Although a ghost cannot affect its anchor directly, it can affect the dreams of all those within its "domain." This has the same effect as the Night Terrors Hindrance.
· Poltergeist: Once a day, a ghost can create a storm of small objects in an area the size of a Large Burst Template. The storm may move up to 2d6" per round. Anyone inside suffers 2d4 damage per round. The storm lasts 2d6 rounds. Make sure to keep the duration secret from the posse.
· Terror: The ghost can reveal its most heinous form, forcing those who witness it to make a second Guts roll with a ­2 modifier.
· Weakness (Exorcism): Exorcism releases a phantom from its torment.

99
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Most ghosts can also be permanently laid to rest if a hero manages to rectify whatever caused it to remain in our world. This might be anything from finding out some hidden truth, avenging its murder, or delivering its remains to its family.
Ghoul
Ghouls are human-shaped and around five feet tall, though they appear shorter due to their stooped, shuffling gait. Their skin is corpse gray and is often covered in sores or pustules.
Ghouls feed on the dead. They will eat any corpse, but they prefer fresh meat, so are often found near battlefields, though they have been known to grab those too badly wounded to defend themselves as well.
These grotesque creatures live in groups underground, and are led by a bloated, bestial ghoul king (who is a Wild Card).

Giant Octopus
Giant octopi have large bulbous heads about 10' in diameter and eight tentacles each upwards of 20' in length. They are most often a mottled brown or gray in color, but are capable of limited chameleonic color changes. They often feed on beasts that other creatures wouldn't think of tangling with, including sharks and killer whales (and unfortunate sailors).
Giant octopi grab and crush their prey into unconsciousness with their tentacles, but they are limited to one tentacle attack per target unless the victim is at least Large Size. The octopus can also bite with its central beak, but it usually only does so once a victim is Incapacitated.

Giant Saltwater Crocodile
This enormous crocodile grows up to 30' long, and its business end is dominated by jaws that can crush small water craft into matchsticks. They are found primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, though sightings have been reported in the Great Maze as well.
Giant crocodiles use their jaws and terrifying death rolls to devastate their prey, with the tail attack reserved to guard its rear.

'Glom
A 'glom (short for conglomerate) is a group of corpses joined together into a horrifying mass and animated by an especially strong manitou. The parts of the component bodies can be seen clearly, although they are merged inseparably into a single abomination. The creation of a 'glom requires at least two corpses. One corpse, in which the manitou houses its primary essence, must be relatively intact, but the others needn't be so tidy.
Most 'gloms are formed from considerably more than two corpses, usually at the site of a recent battle. Even more terrifying is the 'glom's ability to join additional corpses to its seething mass, increasing its power proportionately
'Gloms use their limbs and whatever weapons are handy to kill any living person in sight. Whenever possible, 'gloms add corpses to their mass. 'Gloms can wield guns if available, though since

its limbs often flail wildly, any shots fired by the 'glom suffer a ­2 penalty.
Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d4, Strength d8, Vigor d8
Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d6, Notice d10, Shooting d6
Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9
Gear: 'Gloms may carry weapons according to the number of hands they possess.
Special Abilities:
· Claws: Str+d4. Strength depends on the number of corpses in the creature.
· Fear (­2): Anyone viewing a 'glom must make a Guts roll (­2).
· Fearless: 'Gloms are immune to Fear and Intimidation.
· 'Glom: A 'glom takes a full round to add a corpse to its mass. For every corpse after the second, the 'glom gains one die each in Strength and Vigor. It also gains +1 Size. A 'glom suffers no multi-action penalties until it takes more actions in a turn than it has corpses in its mass. A 'glom may grow as large as 10 corpses (Strength and Vigor d12+6, Size +9, Toughness 22).
· Size +1: 'Gloms start out with two corpses incorporated into their mass.
· Undead: +2 Toughness. +2 to recover from being Shaken. Called shots do no extra damage.
· Weakness (Head): Shots to the 'glom's primary head do +2 damage. A Notice roll at a ­1 cumulative penalty for each 'glommed body reveals which of a 'glom's many heads is the primary.
Gremlin
Gremlins infect mechanical devices. Their spirit form resides within, and causes the device to malfunction on occasion. The number of gremlins in a particular device depends on its size.

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

102

Small items hold up to four gremlins. Medium devices (i.e., bigger than a breadbox) hold up to eight of these malignant spirits. Large machines, such as steam wagons, contain ten or more gremlins. A gizmo or infernal device (a device created by weird science) doubles the usual number!
The gremlins remain in the device until it is destroyed, it is exorcised, or the device is taken onto conse crated ground. When any of the above happen, the gremlins erupt from the device in physical form and may be slain normally. They cannot inhabit another device for at least 24 hours, so they usually try to escape as quickly as possible.

Hangin' Judge
From 1863­69, five Confederate circuit judges formed a secret alliance to steal land, ruin their rivals, and eliminate anyone who stood in the way of their wealth and fame. Those who opposed them were framed for "hangin' offenses," and hauled to the nearest tree for a lynching.
After six years of tyranny, the locals-- mostly hot-blooded Texans--fought back. They rounded up all the judges and hung them from trees all along the Chisholm Trail as a warning to other authorities who would abuse their power.
The Reckoners seized the opportunity to infuse the wicked spirits of the terrible judges with unholy energy and send them back to earth as abominations.

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook

Now the hangin' judges stalk the Chisholm by night, terrorizing anyone who happens to cross their path. They might decide blue is illegal one day and whistling Dixie is a hangin' offense the next. Being from Texas is always a heinous crime in these horrors' evil book of the law. Whatever the "charge," they decide to bring, the judges' sentences are always death. And death is the judges' stock in trade.
Hangin' judges are solitary and relentless hunters. Once they're on someone's trail, they stay with him until he's dead or morning comes. If their quarry is killed, they string him up along the Chisholm Trail and paint the victim's offense on his forehead in blood.
The judges never speak except to whisper their prey's offense over and over.

· Improved Dodge: Attackers subtract 2 from their Shooting and Throwing rolls, and the judges add +2 to rolls to evade area effect weapons (when allowed).
· Improved Level Headed: A hangin' judge draws two additional action cards and acts on the best.
· Improved Nerves of Steel: Hangin' judges ignore two points of wound penalties.
· Invulnerability: The only way to destroy a judge is to hang 'im high (good luck there!). Bullets fired from a lawman's gun can put them down, but unless they're hung afterwards, they return the following night hell bent on vengeance.
· Marksman: If a hangin' judge does not move in a turn, he may fire as if he took the aim maneuver.
· Pistol Scythes: Str+d6. The pistols of these horrors are fitted with scythes the judges can use in melee combat. A raise on the Fighting roll allows a judge to fire his pistol at the same target as a free action.
· Stone Killers: Hangin' judges roll a d10 Wild Die when firing their pistols.
· Two-Fisted: When attacking with a weapon in each hand, the hangin' judge ignores the multi-action penalty.
· Coup: Hangin' judges are horrors of the highest order. If a hangin' judge is destroyed, a Harrowed gets the judge's twin, autoloading Army revolvers as coup. They won't fire even a single shot in the hands of a living person, however.

Horned Serpent
A horned serpent's belly is solid black, while the rest of its long body is covered with scales of multiple shades of green and blue. Its head is viper-like, similar to that of a rattlesnake or water moccasin. From the crown of its head to the base of its neck, however, runs a series of small, bony horns. On either side of this crest is a single long, sharp horn, each about two feet long.
These creatures dwell in the deeper rivers of the Southwest where they lurk beneath the surface, and wait for prey to approach for a drink. When the serpent strikes, it delivers a poisonous bite then coils around its victim to hold the poor sap while it feasts. The horned serpent uses its shape-changing ability to hunt outside its normal domain, but if its true nature is discovered, it reverts to its serpent form and attempts to escape. If it's cornered, it never gives up without a fight.

· Horns: Str+d6.
· Poison: Anyone Wounded by the serpent's bite must make a Vigor roll (­2). Those who succeed gain one Fatigue level which can be recovered after an hour's rest. Those who fail are knocked unconscious for 1d4 hours.
· Shape Change: The serpent has access to the shape change power. It is activated through Spirit rolls and costs no power points. It can change its shape to become identical to any creature it has preyed upon within the last 24 hours. After this time period, it can no longer change its shape into a copy of that victim, though it may remain in that form indefinitely.
Humbug
The mercifully rare humbug is related to the common cicada. It mostly keeps to itself, but when it gets the urge to mate it lets out a terrible screeching whine intended to attract a humbug of the opposite sex. Unfortunately, few other creatures can take the noise, which covers a huge range of frequencies at a ridiculously high volume.
The humbug's mating call is so piercing that it prevents anyone from getting any sleep for miles around. Towns usually

go into a tizzy if they've got a humbug infestation, because nobody can get any sleep, which makes everyone irritable and prone to violence. The humbug is a cowardly little critter that loves to hide in hard-to-reach places. If attacked, the insect modifies its mating call to be downright deadly. Usually, humbugs find a mate after about a month. When it finally shuts up, however, any nearby towns have already suffered outbursts of violence thanks to its influence.

· Size ­2: The humbug is a small insect.
· Sonic Attack: Once a humbug is provoked, everyone within a Large Burst Template centered on the critter must make a Spirit roll on its action or suffer 2d4 damage. This damage is sonic and completely bypasses armor (though thick wax earplugs reduce the damage to 1d4). If a humbug is left alone for a round, it resumes its usual irritating (but not damaging) Sonic Drone.
· Sonic Drone: Everything within five miles vibrates and shakes, preventing sleep even for the deaf. Only those with earplugs or the Hard of Hearing Hindrance can even attempt to sleep (Spirit roll at ­4 each hour). Each night without rest inflicts one Fatigue level from sleep deprivation, which can be

· Tiny: Any attacks against a humbug suffer a ­4 penalty due to its size.

Jackalope
Jackalopes are omens of bad tidings. They stalk a party and wait for bad luck to strike, then feed off the remains of those who don't survive it.
These little beasties are damned hard to kill. They have a sixth sense that warns them whenever they are about to meet danger, and they're fast enough to get out of the way when they do.
The best way to get rid of one of these tenacious critters is to kill it or to cross running water. Jackalopes can't swim, so unless they find a bridge or some other way across, they simply hop off to find easier prey.
On the plus side, jackalope feet are good luck charms. Anyone wearing one has the Great Luck Edge. The charm decays after about a month, at which time it's rendered useless.

· Coup: The jackalope's coup is good luck. A Harrowed who absorbs its essence gains the Luck Edge. This coup can only be claimed once.
Los Diablos
Los Diablos have haunted humanity for thousands of years. Other cultures knew them as minotaurs and gorgons. In the Weird West, they have taken on the forms of mutated Texas longhorns. They are the ultimate harbingers of doom, for they are one of the only direct servants of the mysterious Reckoners.
Los Diablos hunt posses who become thorns in the Reckoners' sides. Fate rules even these mighty beings, however, so Los Diablos are only allowed to walk

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
the earth on certain occasions. When all the characters in a posse are at least Heroic rank, and gain the attention of the Reckoners by foiling one of their better schemes, Los Diablos pay them a visit. Loners are usually left alone-- sending the devil bulls after individuals is overkill even for the Reckoners.
Have the posse make a Guts check the first night the bulls are heard. On a failure, a hero loses his highest Fate Chip. Worse still, once Los Diablos have the posse's scent, the characters cannot draw new Fate Chips for any reason.
The next night, the rumbling grows louder, and everyone must make a Guts check at ­2 or lose a Fate Chip. On the third night the penalty increases to ­4, and finally to ­6 on the fourth night.
On the fifth night of the hunt, Los Diablos appear, smashing through walls, doors, or windows to get at their prey. There is one diablo for every character of Heroic rank or higher in the group. These heroes are the devil bulls' sworn enemies and the only individuals Fate allows them to hunt.
The bulls can only harm or be harmed by those of Heroic rank or higher, and fight until they or all their prey are dead. Those who die fighting Los Diablos forever join them; their souls are taken into the Hunting Grounds to become diablos.
The Devil's Own Herd: Those around the posse aren't safe either. Los Diablos ride at the head of a ghostly stampede called the "Devil's Own Herd."
These creatures are actually the souls of all those the herd has slain before.
The ghostly herd cannot harm characters of Heroic rank or higher, but other unfortunates within a hundred yards are "trampled" by their demonic hooves. These bystanders must make a Spirit roll each round or suffer a level of

Fatigue, which can lead to their death. Unfortunate bystanders who die in this way become another damned soul in the Devil's Own Herd.
Nothing on Earth can harm the herd. They dissipate instantly when all Los Diablos or their prey are dead.

Mourning Mist
A mourning mist is a dark red cloud between eight and 10 feet in diameter. The cloud is amorphous with thick tentacles and thin tendrils extending far beyond the core. A study of the mist from closer than 10 feet reveals shadowy human faces twisted in screams of agony moving throughout the creature's body.
Mourning mists are born at the sites of particularly ignoble battles, places where cowardice or treachery caused a disastrous defeat or the loss of many lives. The mist typically lurks only on the infamous battlefield where it was born, but some have been known to follow museums and traveling displays filled with relics anchor for the spirit from the treacherous fight.

Pace: 24; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9
Special Abilities:
· Chilling Touch: As a touch attack the mist causes 2d6 damage with its icy fingers. This attack ignores nonmagical armor. It cannot be used with Pain Touch.
· Fear (­2): Anyone encountering a mourning mist must make a Guts roll (­2).
· Ethereal: Mourning mists can only be harmed by magic. If "killed," it reappears the following sunset unless the battlefield it was born on is sanctified.
· Improved Sweep: The mourning mist may make a single Fighting attack and apply it against all adjacent targets. It can use this in conjunction with either of its touch attacks.
· Pain Touch: The usual attack for a mourning mist is to share its pain

through visions with a victim after a successful touch attack. Victims must make a Spirit roll (­2) or become Shaken. The visions are usually nightmarish and chaotic but also give hints to the mist's `anchor'--which must be destroyed to free the mist.
· Reach 4: The mourning mist's gaseous tendrils allow it to make melee attacks on targets up to 4" away.
· Voices o' Hell: A mourning mist can unleash a hellish cry of pain as an action. Each hero within 10" of the mist must make a Spirit roll or be Shaken.
· Weakness (Hallowed Ground): If the mist's battlefield is sanctified, it doesn't disappear, but won't return if destroyed as long as the ground remains hallowed.
Mudsucker
These large, leech-like creatures lair in muddy banks near stagnant waters, including bogs, ponds, and swamps. Individual mudsuckers hollow out small chambers to store their meals for later consumption. When hunting, they lie in the shallows of murky waters and grab their prey as it passes nearby.
Although their bite is not terribly formidable, mudsuckers tend to latch on and won't let go. Once attached, mudsuckers inject their venom, which incapacitates the victim so it can be safely dragged underwater.

· Paralysis: If a mudsucker bite causes a wound, the victim must make a Vigor roll or be paralyzed for 2d4 minutes.
· Size +1: A mudsucker is slightly larger and heavier than a human.
Nibbler Swarm
These fish resemble their larger South American cousins, the piranha. They are between three and four inches in length and fairly narrow. Their scales are a blood red color and their mouths feature a pugnacious underbite filled with needlelike fangs.
Due to the influence of the Reckoning, these ferocious little biters live in both fresh and salt water, and freely travel between the two. They normally travel in schools of 300 or more, and infested waters may contain thousands of individuals. Any animal entering such waters is likely to survive only a few moments before being completely stripped of its flesh.

E nc ou n t e r s
splashing, stomping, and flailing doesn't bother them.
· Tenacious: When a nibbler swarm takes a wound, it splits into two smaller swarms, each the size of a Medium Burst Template with Toughness 5. If either of these swarms is wounded, it splits into two swarms the size of a Small Burst Template, but the smaller swarms' Toughness remains 5.
Night Haunts
Night haunts are evil creatures of corrupted shadow that subsist on human souls. They are lone hunters that appear only at dusk, following travelers across the plains, waiting for them to make camp for the night.
These shadowy killers are patient hunters. When a night haunt spots its prey, it hides away in the enshrouding darkness and waits for most of the travelers to fall asleep. Then it begins its insidious attack, using mimicry and illusion to draw out its chosen foe.
The camp's guard likely sees strange "patches" of darkness, or hears a distant baby's cry or some far-off screams-- anything the night haunt can do to unnerve its prey. Its goal is to lure the guard out alone, preferably without waking his companions. If the night haunt is successful, it draws the poor fool out further from the safety of his compadres, until he's entirely isolated, and then attacks with its soul-wrenching claws.
When it has killed its victim, it feasts greedily on the fleeing soul. As a result, the unfortunate victims of a night haunt never return from the grave Harrowed.

Night Horror
Many cowpokes experienced in just how weird the west can get have learned to hate the night. Sometimes the night hates them back. Night horrors can lure their prey out into the dark with illusion and mimicry. Those who have experienced this and survived report that they knew their actions were suicidal, but they could not help themselves. It was as if the abomination controlled them. Horrors also appear able to use the night as a weapon. Most terrifying of all, those killed by horrors return the very next night as a freshly spawned night haunt! Victims of a night horror never return from the grave as Harrowed.

· Dark Tentacles: Night horrors cause the night itself to coalesce into tentacles of solid darkness, which attack all around it. This lowers the horror's Spirit by 1 die type for the rest of the night and is usually used to cover the horror's escape.

Night Raven
Night ravens are an Indian myth brought to life by the Reckoners. The birds are attracted to vivid dreams and establish a psychic link with the dreamer. The raven then alters the content of the dream by drawing upon the sleeper's worries and fears, then feeds upon the anxiety caused by the newly born nightmare.
Night ravens sometimes serve other abominations, or even human sorcerers. They are frequently tasked with inflicting nightmares on their master's enemies.
The winged tormentors prefer to attack over several nights. At first, the changes it makes in the sleeper's dreams are minor, but with each visit the terror increases. Night ravens never physically attack and flee from dangerous situations. When threatened, the bird tries to make eye contact and frighten the attacker into inaction long enough to escape.

Each night after the first, the victim has a cumulative ­1 to this Guts roll to a maximum of ­5. At ­3, the victim gains a permanent Fatigue level which abates after a week of peaceful

sleep. At ­5, wounds from the dreams appear on the flesh of the victim, though they are superficial. The visits continue until the raven is killed, or the victim dies of fright in his sleep (per the Fright Table).
· Size ­2: These birds are indistinguishable from other ravens.
· Small: Any attack rolls targeting a night raven suffer a ­2 penalty due to its size.
Nosferatu
Nosferatu are voracious, bloodsucking abominations intent on little more than finding their next meal. These creatures' arrival in the Weird West is thanks to Baron LaCroix's infamous "Night Trains."
Originally found only in a few isolated areas of the American Southwest, trainloads of these monsters were released onto the network of railroads inside the Disputed Territories. Although efforts by the Texas Rangers and Agency

have been fairly successful in eliminating the resultant nests, smaller packs of these bloodsuckers still exist in scattered pockets throughout both countries.
Nosferatu are bald and emaciated humanoids. Their eyes are solid black, with a tiny spark of red visible in the center. Coarse, brown claws tip their fingers and toes, while chisel-like incisors protrude from between their withered lips. When they bother to speak at all, it is only with sibilant, hissing growls.

· Weakness (Sunlight): Nosferatu suffer a Fatigue level every round they are exposed to sunlight. Once Incapacitated, further exposure (about 10 seconds) kills them. These Fatigue levels recover only if the creature is able to feast on fresh blood. Even one pint is enough for a nosferatu to be fully restored.
Patchwork Man
Patchwork men are obviously artificial creations. Large sewing and grafting scars crisscross their bodies, and limbs occasionally jut out at odd angles. Some even have animal parts grafted to their undead flesh! Patchwork men seldom display the decay or other signs of undeath common among walkin' dead.
As a general rule, patchwork men are bound by their creator's will, and in combat tend to follow whatever instructions have been laid out for them. Those with a measure of independent thought tend to be brutal killers.

When a patchwork man would normally be Incapacitated, instead roll on the Injury Table and apply the appropriate penalty. If a hero makes a called shot to a patchwork man's limb, don't roll on the Injury Table; instead, that limb simply ceases to function.

The pit wasp is a gigantic version of its smaller namesake. Its spiky exoskeleton is predominantly red, so those folks unfortunate enough to live close to a hive of the critters call them "redcoats." The things range between two and six feet long.
Pit wasps consume wood, and usually build their nests in forested reg ions, but have been known to dem olish small towns in search of sustenance.

Pit wasp nests are usually 12 to 30 feet tall and 20 to 90 feet across, with tunnels and pits dug beneath them. The tunnels branch out into the ground, and the entrance to the nest can be located up to a mile from the main body of it. These underground passages sometimes run close to the surface, and it isn't unheard of for a person or animal to fall through the ceiling of a tunnel. Fortunately for any wasp hunters, these nests have the consistency of paper, and burn fairly easily.

Poison Woman
Native stories suggest that whenever a woman kills a man with poison within the borders of the Sioux Nations (including Deadwood), there is a chance she becomes a poison woman.

E nc ou n t e r s
At first glance, a poison woman looks exactly as she did in life. Closer examination reveals that her legs are much thicker and stronger than before, however. The top of her skull is missing, and part of her brains are exposed. As a result, a poison woman likes to wears a hat or scarf to cover up her brain, since it is her only weakness, and her disfigurement is immediately obvious.
Following her resurrection the new abomination can pick out pieces of her brain and use them to poison foods. The poison woman attempts to do just that to any unwary travelers who accept her offer of a home-cooked meal, a meal that usually turns out to be the weary traveler's last!

· Invulnerability: Poison women do not suffer wounds from magic or mundane damage, though they may be Shaken.
· Poison: A poison woman can pull parts of her own brain out through the opening in her skull and use it to poison a meal. Anyone who consumes the meal must make a Vigor roll or die. Even those who succeed gain two Fatigue levels (one with a raise) as spasms and convulsions wrack his body.

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
· Weakness (Back o' the Head): Called shots to the back of a poison woman's head do normal damage.
· Coup: A Harrowed who counts coup on a poison woman duplicates the creature's peculiar brain chemistry. He may inflict a wound on himself to pull out a bit of his own gray matter (usually through his nose), which he can then use to poison a meal as described above.
Pole Man
When Sioux patrols are forced to kill trespassing miners (usually when the miner draws a gun), they turn the body over to the miner's compatriots. If no one claims the body, they lash it to a pole along the road leading out of Deadwood.
There, these unfortunates serve as a warning to other miners who might get out of line. The sweet fear they produce caught the Reckoners' attention, and they gave life to a new abomination: the pole men.
On rainy nights, the water loosens the grisly gray flesh of the creatures on the poles and grants them unholy life. As a lone victim passes beneath, the horror's dead eyes open, there legs elongate to reach the ground, and their rubbery arms shake loose of their bonds.
If the pole men capture a sorry traveler, they erect a new pole and tie the victim up. Death comes slowly from the loop the horrors place around his neck (use the rules for Hanging in the Deadlands Player's Guide).

Skills: Fighting d12, Notice d8, Stealth d12
Pace: 14; Parry: 8; Toughness: 7

Special Abilities:
· Entangle: The pole men usually have little trouble with their prey, because the poor sod is dumbstruck with terror. That said, if someone manages to fight back, the pole men resort to grappling. Once the target is successfully grappled, he has three rounds to escape before the pole men finish lashing him up on a pole of his very own.
· Fear (­1): The pole men are a terrifying sight.
· Fearless: Pole men are immune to Fear and Intimidation.
· Long-Legged: Pace 14. Gangly pole men move at a pretty good clip.
· Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken. Called shots do no extra damage.
· Coup: The Harrowed's arms become long and rubbery, giving him a +1 bonus to his Reach with any melee weapon.
Pox Walker
When a particularly angry brave or shaman dies of smallpox or some other disease brought by the white man, the Reckoners sometimes take note and grant the brave new life as an abomination.
A pox walker appears as an Indian whose skin is pocked with pus­filled sores that ooze a sickly yellow fluid. Its flesh hangs limply where sores have burst. Its eyes are milky, and its body wracked by tremors. Froth gathers at the corners of its mouth, and it dribbles gobbets of sputum as it exhales.
Pox walkers are solitary creatures who use stealth and vicious cunning to spread the disease among those they feel have wronged them. Pox walkers victimize white settlements over all

118
John Rogers (Order #49932984)

others, and some have thrown themselves off cliffs or into rivers rather than attack their fellow tribesmen (though this is rare). Woe betide any brave who thinks himself safe because of his race.
Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6, Spirit d6, Strength d8, Vigor d10
Skills: Climbing d6, Fighting d8, Notice d6, Stealth d8
Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9
Gear: Bow (12/24/48, 2d6), knife (Str+d4).
Special Abilities:
· Fear (­2): Anyone who looks upon a pox walker's ravaged flesh must make a Guts roll (­2).
· Fearless: Pox walkers are immune to Fear and Intimidation.
· Pox: Heroes infected with the pox must make a Vigor roll each week or gain a Fatigue level from the disease. Each time the victim comes in close contact with another human (usually touch), the other party must make a Vigor roll or become infected himself. This Vigor roll suffers a penalty equal to the carrier's own Fatigue penalty. If someone infected with the pox succeeds in three weekly Vigor rolls in a row, he recovers from the disease. Otherwise, he dies as soon as he fails one such Vigor roll while already Incapacitated. As this disease is magical in nature, Harrowed may be infected by the pox walker itself, but cannot be infected with the disease by subsequent carriers. The ghastly monstrosities have three ways of spreading their plague (see below).
· Spatter: If a hero's attack roll comes up snake eyes while attacking a pox walker, several of the creature's sores burst and spray all those adjacent

E nc ou n t e r s
with diseased pus. Everyone adjacent to the pox walker must make a Vigor roll at ­2 or be infected with the pox (see above). · Tainted Weapons: The vile creature covers its arrows or knife blade with its filth. Anytime an infected weapon causes a wound, the victim must make a Vigor roll (­2) or contract the pox (see above). · Undead: +2 Toughness. +2 to recover from being Shaken. Called shots do no extra damage. · Virulent Breath: If the pox walker manages to grapple a target, it may exhale a menagerie of germs and bacteria at its opponent on its next action. The victim must make a Vigor roll (­2) or be infected with the pox (see above). · Coup: A Harrowed who absorbs a pox walker's coup may thereafter cure disease by taking the infection into himself. He need only lay hands on the victim to do so. For the week following, the Harrowed suffers

one level of Fatigue as he suffers the effects of the disease. At the end of that week, the disease is flushed from his system.
Prairie Tick
Prairie ticks are the scourge of the High Plains. These horrid bloodsuckers live in underground burrows, and are rumored to be controlled by a single, giant queen that rules over each nest.
When prairie ticks sense prey, they crawl out of their burrow and bound through the tall prairie grass at top speed. They can sense the vibration of a man walking across the desert up to 50 yards away, double that for horses, and quadruple for wagons.
Prairie ticks leap for the mouth and pull the victim's lips down with their two front hooks, then crawl down the victim's throat. Once inside, the thing's hooked legs sink into the innards and it

begins to drain its host's blood. As the host dies, the tick gets larger. Days later, it bursts the ribcage and comes crawling out of the stomach or throat.
Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d4, Strength d4, Vigor d4
Skills: Fighting d10, Notice d10, Stealth d10
Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 3 (1)
Special Abilities:
· Armor +1: Prairie ticks have thick, chitinous carapace.
· Hooks: A prairie tick that hits with a raise yanks his victim's lip down and crawls into his throat. Every hour thereafter, the victim must make a Fatigue roll. Death means the tick has grown large enough to burst out of the ribcage in a gory explosion.
· Size ­2: The ticks are the size of a man's fist, and suffer ­2 to their Toughness.
· Small: Attack rolls against these creatures suffer a ­2 penalty.
· Weakness: The only known way to remove a prairie tick inside a host is to pour a quart of castor oil down the victim's throat. The host needs to make a Vigor roll (­2) to get the stuff down. If he does, the tick comes crawling out and can be easily squished.
Prairie Tick Hatchling Swarm
Prairie tick hatchlings ride on the abdomen of the queen or nest in the central chamber of the warren until they reach full size. If the queen comes under attack, she mobilizes the hatchlings into swarms to combat the intruders.
Hatchlings are in every respect just like a larger prairie tick, except they have an easier time slipping down some poor sap's throat.

Pace: 5; Parry: 8; Toughness: 6 (1)
Special Abilities:
· Armor +1: Hatchlings have tough carapaces.
· Bite: Hatchling swarms bite for 2d4 damage per round against every target within the area covered by a Medium Burst Template.
· Hooks: Each round, each swarm of hatchlings may make a Fighting roll against one target under the swarm template. This attack inflicts no damage, but on a successful attack a single tick hatchling climbs down the target's throat. Starting at the end of the next hour, the target must make a Vigor roll each hour or suffer one level of Fatigue. If the creature dies from this Fatigue, the now full-grown prairie tick bursts from its guts in a shower of blood and gore.
· Split: Prairie tick hatchlings under the guidance of a prairie tick queen can split into two smaller swarms each the size of a Small Burst Template. These swarms have a Toughness of 4 (1).
· Swarm: +2 Parry. Hatchling swarms cover the area of a Medium Burst Template. Cutting and piercing weapons do no damage. Area effect weapons work normally, and a character can stomp to inflict her Strength in damage each turn.
· Weakness (Castor Oil): Anyone who has swallowed a prairie tick hatchling can drink half-a-quart of castor oil-- which requires a Vigor roll to keep down. Success kills the critter.

E nc ou n t e r s
Prairie Tick Queen
A prairie tick queen lives in the central chamber of the warren. This chamber is typically more than 20' in diameter, but most tunnels leading to it are no more than 2' around. The queen is fed by the bloated drones from the prairies above. Queens evolve from drones when an old queen dies, or a drone strays far enough from one colony to start another. In other words, whenever there is no other queen nearby.
When she is receiving an adequate supply of blood, the queen lays many eggs and spawns many hatchlings at once--often enough for a swarm, perhaps even two. She uses the swarm to defend herself and only enters a fight if pressed. A queen is too fat to fit down most critter's throats, so she simply uses her hooks to flay her opponent's flesh.

· Hive Mind: The queen can control all prairie ticks within 100 yards, coordinating their activities for hunting and defending the nest. This allows prairie ticks to increase the usual bonus for ganging up, to a maximum of +6 instead of +4.
· Size ­2: A prairie tick queen is about the size of a small dog.
· Small: Attack rolls against these creatures suffer a ­2 penalty.

Rattler
They call these great worms "rattlers" because a person's teeth start chattering as the rattler rumbles through the earth beneath him. Though they are most common in the Mojave, rattlers are also found in isolated flatlands in Montana and Utah. The rattlers of each region tend to have their own colors and even personalities.
Mojave rattlers go straight for the kill, while the ones in Montana are skulkers. Utah rattlers are smaller but faster, and they absolutely love to chase steam wagons across the great Salt Flats. Like Maze dragons, rattlers are accepted near the regions they terrorize. Folks Back East think Westerners exaggerate, but the locals know better.
The greatest secret of the rattlers is that they're not creatures of the Reckoning. They were awakened by it, however. Long

ago, the rattlers were a race of near-gods, ruling over the primordial creatures of Earth's past. Their reign ended under mysterious circumstances, but they have been slowly attempt ing to recruit new worshippers from the odd creatures (humans) who now tread upon their former domain.
When a rattler moves in for the kill, it bursts up through the earth and tries to snag its prey with one of its tentacles. Though they have many ten tacles, they never attempt to capture multiple targets unless their intended victims are very close together, such as a horse and rider, preferring to focus on a single quarry.
Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d8, Spirit d8, Strength d12+6, Vigor d12+2
Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d10, Notice d8, Stealth d8
Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 26 (2)
Special Abilities:
· Armor +2: The worms are covered in thick, scaly skin. Clothing made of rattler hide (available only through a few merchants in the Southwest for hundreds of dollars per article) grants Armor +1.
· Bite: Str+d12.
· Burrowing: 18".
· Fear (­2): Anyone who encounters a rattler must make a Guts roll (­2).
· Gargantuan: Heavy Armor. Attackers add +4 to their rolls to hit a rattler. Using its entire bulk, a rattler can slam itself down upon a foe or an obstacle. Add Size bonus to Strength for damage. Rattlers can affect an area equivalent to a Cone Template with their slam attack.

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

122

· Fear (­2): Anyone who encounters a rattler must make a Guts roll (­2).
· Seismic Sensors: Rattlers sense their prey by vibrations in the sand. They can detect the movement of a man up to 100" (200 yards) distant. This is an opposed Notice versus Stealth if the prey is trying to step lightly (­2 if running), otherwise just a Notice roll for the rattler. Horses are detected at double the distance, wagons at triple.
· Size +15: The great worms are well over 50 yards long!
· Tentacles: Rattler tentacles are 20" long. Once they grapple a target, they begin dragging them toward their maw. Each success and raise on an opposed Strength roll drags the victim 1d6" closer to the hungry mouth. Each tentacle can take a single wound, but has a Toughness of 12. Bullets and impaling weapons cause half damage, while blunt attacks inflict no damage. Wounds inflicted on tentacles do not harm the rattler.
· Weakness (Nerve Cluster): Rattlers have a cluster of nerves deep in their bodies at the nexus of their tentacles. If targeted with a called shot (­6), damage ignores both the Size modifier and Heavy Armor of the rattler. Of course, the danger is in getting close enough to the rattler to take the shot!
· Coup: Any deader who kills a worm gains the ability to burrow up to 5 x their Spirit (as per the Monstrous Ability).
Rattler Young 'Un
Rattler larvae are found all over the Badlands. Strangely, all the baby rattlers trappers kill in the area are about three feet long. Theory goes the creatures stay underground until they reach this size,

E nc ou n t e r s
prowl around the surface for a while, then go down for further incubation.
Young rattlers travel in packs of six or more.

Replicant
These abominations are actually a form of intelligent plant life. While still a pod, a replicant forms a psychic connection with the nearest human mind and begins to grow. Initially, it is a featureless humanoid, but when the process is complete, the replicant is a perfect physical copy of the victim. There is one simple difference, however: replicants do not bleed. Instead, any wounds ooze a thick, white sap.
Once "born," the replicant must make physical contact with its victim to gain access to his memories and personality, which it typically attempts while the victim is asleep. After the transfer, the replicant is capable of mimicking its victim almost perfectly. Close friends or relatives may notice a few inconsistencies in the host's behavior on a successful Notice roll (­4).
Fortunately, replicants reproduce slowly. Each abomination can produce a new seedpod once a month. These monsters are usually discovered long before they have the chance to overrun a settlement, which is exactly what the Reckoners want. After all, a town full of pod people isn't worth much to them; a town with only a few pod people and a paranoid human population is gold.
Attributes: Agility d4*, Smarts d8, Spirit d10, Strength d4*, Vigor d8
Skills: Fighting d4, Notice d4, Stealth d4 (until memory drain)
Pace: 4*; Parry: 4*; Toughness: 6
Special Abilities:
· Construct: +2 to recover from Shaken. No additional damage from called shots. Immune to disease and poison.
· Fearless: Replicants are immune to Fear and Intimidation.
· Hardy: A second Shaken result does not cause a wound on a replicant.

· Memory Drain: When a replicant first emerges from its pod, it uses its rudimentary skills to locate and touch its victim. After five minutes of contact and a success on an opposed Spirit roll, the victim dies and the replicant gains all skills and all physical Edges and Hindrances possessed by the targeted character. Traits and secondary statistics marked with an asterisk are replaced by the victim's. Arcane Backgrounds and skills linked to Smarts are not drained, though the replicant attempts to duplicate the appropriate behaviors. If the replicant cannot drain the memory of its source character within 24 hours, the monstrous creature melts into a puddle of sickly green goo.
· Wild Card: If the drained individual was a Wild Card, the replicant also gains Wild Card status.
River Leviathan
The river leviathan, sometimes known as a "river fiend," is an octopus altered by the Reckoners into a monster about 40 feet across, with tentacles about 20 feet in length. Most of the time, this critter sits on the bottom of a river, tentacles extended upward to grab prey. It can also rise to the surface of the water, and sometimes adopts a wrecked ship or other large object as an improvised shell before it goes off in search of prey.
Whether the leviathan is actively hunting or lying in ambush, it first attacks with its long tentacles. In fact, many victims see nothing of the critter but the tentacles, which they sometimes believe are black, eyeless snakes. Those who live past their capture, though, might just catch a glimpse of the leviathan's body before the tentacle deposits them in the thing's mouth.

· Size +9: These gigantic abominations average some 40' across with tentacles over 20' long.
· Swallow: A leviathan that hits with a raise on its tentacle attack automatically grapples its target. The victim has two rounds to escape before the leviathan pops the poor cowpoke into its maw. Characters dragged into the water while grappled must succeed at a Vigor roll every round or start to drown (see Savage Worlds rules). Those swallowed whole suffer 2d6 damage per round from the thing's digestive juices. If the leviathan is killed, any surviving swallowed victims are likely to drown unless they can make an Agility roll to escape the vile beast's now slack gullet.
· Tentacle: Str+d10, Reach 10.
Saddle Burr
Saddle burrs are about the size of walnuts, with brown quills sticking out

E nc ou n t e r s
of them like a prickly pear. They are light enough to be carried by the wind, which means they can be found almost anywhere.
Anyone who tries to squish a burr pushes the quills into his hand. The quills deliver a little jolt of poison that causes swelling and pain for a few days. Rarely are the burrs enough to make anyone water their boots, but the consequences of a burr bite might. Burrs should be used to add a little humor to the campaign or to cause special problems for the posse--like not being able to use a gun hand in a duel the next day. Running from a lynching party to find your horse can barely stand or that you can't use your trigger finger might also be cause for alarm and consternation.
Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d4, Strength d4, Vigor d6
Pace: 1; Parry: 2; Toughness: 3
Special Abilities:
· Immunities (Slashing and Piercing): Saddle burrs are too small to be effectively targeted by piercing and slashing weapons. Magic and bludgeoning attacks affect them normally.
· Poison: Anyone touching a saddle burr bare-handed is stung by the quills. The poor sap must make a Vigor roll or suffer a ­1 penalty to all actions requiring the use of the stung area for the next 1d4 days. A stung hand causes a ­1 penalty to Fighting, Shooting, and Throwing rolls making use of it, for example. Multiple stings inflict a cumulative penalty.
· Proliferation: If Shaken in combat, saddle burrs create 1d4 more of their kind. These have a 50/50 chance of catching on an adjacent target. If actually wounded, the thing is destroyed.

Sand Viper
A sand viper looks like a three-footlong, greenish-black conch. A long spike projects from the narrow end of the shell when it's attacking, and small tentacles emerge from the crown to pull the abomination through the sand. Beneath its shell, the sand viper is a large, saltwater mollusk that buries itself in sand just offshore, and is usually found in colonies of 20 or more.
This creature uses its spear-like appendage to inject a powerful paralytic toxin into its victims. Once the target is paralyzed, the sand viper uses the same organ to drain his vital fluids, leaving only a desiccated corpse behind.

Pace: 2; Parry: 5; Toughness: 6 (2)
Special Abilities:
· Armor +2: Sand vipers have a hard shell.
· Burrow: Pace 2. Sand vipers can only burrow through sand or similar substances. More solidly packed soil is too dense for the critter to make much headway.
· Fearless: Sand vipers are immune to Fear and Intimidation.
· Fluid Drain: A sand viper drains bodily fluids from a paralyzed victim at the rate of one Fatigue level per minute. If the creature takes a Fatigue level beyond Incapacitated, it dies.
· Paralysis: Any creature wounded by the sting of a sand viper must make a Vigor roll (­2) or be paralyzed for ten minutes.

· Size ­1: A sand viper is a three-footlong conch and weighs around 50 pounds.
· Sting: Str+d4.

Scarecrow
These abominations are man-made scarecrows animated by the Reckoners and filled with a desire to scare more than just crows. During the growing season, they are active only at night, and spend the rest of the day pretending to be ordinary scarecrows.
Once a scarecrow has taken a life, it can reproduce. It starts by growing seeds (like giant, black kernels of corn) in rows along its belly, one seed for each of its victims. Once these seeds get to be about the size of fists, which takes about a month, they can be planted. The next night, a lesser scarecrow, also known as

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

126

a corn stalker, sprouts in the scarecrow's field.
A corn stalker seed quickly grows to around two feet in height, with sharp claws, a scrawny body made of twisted corn husks, and a head that resembles a pumpkin with a leering face. If the corn stalker takes a life, it leaves its home field in search of a field with a normal scarecrow. Once it finds a suitable location, the corn stalker nestles inside and turns the once-normal scarecrow into another of these abominations.
If a scarecrow is destroyed and any corn stalkers survive, the first corn stalker to take a life may inhabit any new scarecrows erected in the field, inheriting the land from its creator.

Heroes on hold automatically make this roll.
· Size ­1: Cornstalkers are about two feet tall.
Sin Eater
The sin eater looks like a deformed human with shadowy, writhing forms under its skin. Occasionally, a hand or face comes to the surface of the creature's skin, as if attempting to escape its awful prison. The sin eater can take on the physical appearance of any person whose corpse it has devoured. All this abomination requires to work its malicious mojo is the grave of an individual buried in unconsecrated ground within the last week. Once it finds such a grave, the sin eater consumes the corpse and absorbs the soul. It then rises and uses its powers to cause fear among the

enemies of the deceased, as well as grief for the dearly departed's family.

· Sin Eating: Sin eaters consume corpses buried on unhallowed ground, and by doing so absorb the memories of the departed. Everything from a person's life, down to accent, manner of speech, secrets, and facts of the person's history are absorbed. It can then change its shape into a perfect copy of the departed as they were before death, and it may stay in this form for up to 24 hours. Once a disguise is dropped, the sin eater gains a Fatigue level which must be healed before it can take another shape. It may make a Vigor roll every hour, and once successful, the Fatigue is restored.
· Weakness (Dismemberment): If the sin eater is cut limb from limb and each part buried in hallowed ground it will not return to life.
Siren
Sirens are large fish, nearly 25' long, with wide bodies and fang-filled maws. Like a deep-sea angler, a siren has a fourinch-thick appendage which it inserts into the base of the skull of a human corpse, and it uses that corpse as a lure to attract prey--other humans--close enough to be attacked. The siren has limited muscle control over the corpse, but it can issue noises such as screams and unintelligible shouts. Sirens are only found in saltwater, most commonly in the Great Maze.

being animated by a fishy tentacle must make a Guts roll.
· Large: Attack rolls against a siren gain a +2 bonus due to its size.
· Lure: The siren may only apply its Persuasion skill through the use of the lure. A cowpoke who makes a Notice roll against the siren's Persuasion recognizes that something ain't quite right. The siren may also use its Fighting skill to attack with the lure, but the lure uses a d6 Strength die instead of the siren's actual Strength.
· Size +5: A siren is a monstrous, carnivorous fish.
Skinwalker
Skinwalkers are so-named because they usually walk off with the skin of a victim and wear it themselves. They can skin a human in less than five minutes thanks to their wicked retractable claws. During the process, skinwalkers lap at their victims brains with their rasplike tongues, thereby stealing some of the deceased's memories. Even so, an alert hero can still spot oddities in a skinwalker's behavior.
Because the skinwalkers' skeletons are mutable, they may impersonate any size human, no matter if they are child, adult, or elderly. In their normal, skinless state, these abominations resemble a skinned corpse: muscle, tendon, cartilage, and bone are unveiled for all to see.
Baron Simone LaCroix, owner of the Bayou Vermilion railroad, has formed a strange alliance with a number of these creatures. He uses them for a variety of tasks, from spying to terrorism.

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Special Abilities:
· Claws: Str+d6.
· Disguise: A hero must make a Notice roll (­4) to detect anything amiss with a disguised skinwalker. If the hero knows the skinwalker's victim well, the penalty may be reduced to ­2, or even 0 (Marshal's discretion).
· Fear (­1): Anyone who encounters a "naked" skinwalker must make a Guts roll (­1).
· Wild Card: If the victim who "donated" his skin was a Wild Card, the skinwalker also gains Wild Card status.
Terrantula
A sub-species of tarantula which infests the southwestern Confederate states, these horrid beasts swarm when hunting. The spider, identified by a unique set of markings resembling, oddly enough, a human skull, has been given the rather colorful sobriquet "terrantula" by frontiersmen.
The terrantula is believed to have two growth stages: one similar to that of the common tarantula, and a second, much larger size. Many believe that the smaller spiders--roughly the size of a grown man's palm--are hatchlings. Hatchling terrantula swarms are capable of overcoming prey much larger than themselves.
The larger terrantulas reach the size of a small dog. Adults become territorial and use methods similar to that of trapdoor spiders to capture prey. Only the cannibalistic tendencies of these horrible anthropoids prevents terrantulas from dominating the South.
Small Terrantula Swarm Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d12, Strength d8, Vigor d10
Skills: Notice d6

Pace: 10; Parry: 4; Toughness: 7
Special Abilities:
· Bite: Terrantulas inflict hundreds of bites each round, hitting automatically and causing 2d4 damage to everyone in a Medium Burst Template.
· Split: Terrantulas are clever enough to split into two smaller swarms (Small Burst Templates). The Toughness of these smaller swarms is lowered by ­2 (to 5 each).
· Poison: Terrantulas use poison for killing their prey. Anybody wounded by a swarm must roll Vigor. Success indicates the victim shakes off the effects; failure means he's paralyzed for 1d6 hours. A small terrantula's poison is only effective when administered by a swarm; a single bite is painful, but nothing more.
· Swarm: Parry +2; Because the swarm is composed of scores, hundreds, or thousands of creatures, cutting and piercing weapons do no real damage. Area effect weapons work normally, and a character can stomp to inflict his damage in Strength each round. Swarms are evaded by jumping in water.

· Poisonous Bite: Str+2d12.
· Size +8: A terrantula of this size is about 20' tall and 40' across; this is about as big as the monsters realistically get.
Texas Skeeter
These hand-sized insects (six inches long) are gigantic versions of normal mosquitoes. The skeeters travel in swarms, descending on animals and humans alike to feast on their blood.
The name Texas skeeter refers to the critter's size, not its habitat. These nasty blood suckers have been sighted up and down the Mississ ippi, as well as further east. They prefer swampy terrain, and the bayous and bogs of Louisiana are a fertile breeding ground for these pests.

E nc ou n t e r s
Unlike their smaller cousins, skeeters need a lot of blood to survive and tend to attack in large enough swarms to kill rather than simply annoy.
Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d4, Strength d4, Vigor d6
Skills: Notice d8
Pace: 0; Parry: 4; Toughness: 5
Special Abilities:
· Bite/Blood Drain: Swarms inflict hundreds of tiny stings every round to their victims, draining a small amount of blood each time. They hit automatically and cause 2d4 damage to everyone in the swarm's template.
· Flight: Pace 10.
· Swarm: Parry +2. Because the swarm is composed of many smaller creatures, cutting and piercing weapons do no real damage. Area effect weapons work normally.
· Weakness (Fire): Skeeters do not like fire, or even smoke, and don't normally attack anyone close to a fire.

Texas Tummy Twister
The most insidious plague to wrack the Southwest is a microscopic critter that lives in still ponds and muddy swimming holes. Any time a character drinks from a stagnant watering hole in Texas (a critical failure on Survival roll), there's a 1 in 4 chance he picks up one of these buggers.
Once a cowpoke's infected, the twister latches onto his gut and starts drinking blood. Within a week, the parasite grows to the size of a house cat. It also grows a spiny appendage that inserts into the host's spinal column, allowing the twister to exert rudimentary control over the poor sodbuster.
A human under a tummy twister's control isn't particularly bright. The parasite can manage a few words and remember its close friends' names, but that's about it. A successful Notice roll reveals only that the victim is suffering some sort of delirium. The twister can see through its host's eyes, but prefers to burrow out through the host's belly and use its own. When this peephole isn't in use, it leaves a long oozing wound on the host's belly.
The only way to get rid of a twister is to eat something incredibly spicy (or in some cases, force feed it to the host). Jalapenos make the nasty critters come crawling out in a few minutes, causing a wound on the way out (which can't be soaked). Acid gets rid of the little beasties as well, but it'll be a case of curing the disease by killing the patient.
The statistics presented here are for a full-grown tummy twister.
Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4, Spirit d4, Strength d4, Vigor d6
Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d6
Pace: 4; Parry: 5; Toughness: 3

Special Abilities:
· Fear (­1): Anyone who witnesses a tummy twister appear in his buddy's gut (or a stranger's, for that matter), must make a Guts roll (­1).
· Infection: If the tummy twister's tentacles hit with a raise, it impregnates its target with a larval tummy twister. The infection proceeds exactly as if the hombre had become infected by drinking standing water.
· Size ­2: These creatures are the size of a cat.
· Small: Attack rolls against these creatures suffer a ­2 penalty.
· Spiny Tentacles: The tummy twister lashes out from its host's gut with its spiny tentacles, causing 2d4 damage.
Tommyknocker
These carnivorous abominations lurk deep in mines. They damage supports, mine car tracks, and other important structures during the night. Miners and watchmen sometimes hear the creature tapping away down in the depths after the work force knocks off for the night. Should the creature succeed in causing a cave-in, it hunts down and feeds on any trapped miners, picking them off one by one as lack of food and oxygen weakens them.
Tommyknockers primarily haunt gold and silver mines, though they'll lurk in a tapped-out ghost rock mine, as well. They won't typically interfere with a ghost rock operation, though this is more out of instinct than any understanding of the mineral's value to the Reckoners. A tommyknocker--or the mere rumor of one--can be responsible for raising the Fear Level in a mine almost overnight.
Tommyknockers are three-foot-tall humano ids with disproportionately large heads. They are perpetually

· Size ­1: Tommyknockers are somewhat smaller than humans.
· Weakness (Light): Each round that tommyknockers are exposed to light brighter than torchlight, they take 2d6 damage. Tommyknockers killed in this fashion quickly boil away to nothing, leaving only a putrid cloud of steam behind.
Tumblebleed
In the Weird West, even the tumble weeds are out to get you.
Tumblebleeds are vicious critters that look just like tumbleweeds, the dried plants you see blowing across the desolate desert plains. They attack by rolling into a victim and entangling him in their thorny branches. The things' mouths and spiny thorns then penetrate the skin and drain the prey's blood.
Tumblebleeds usually travel in packs for more efficient hunting. Hungry tumblebleeds stay well away from any

E nc ou n t e r s
prey carrying fire--they burn like dry tinder when they haven't fed recently.
A tumblebleed that has just feasted looks like a pile of wet, bloody seaweed. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d4, Strength d6, Vigor d4 Skills: Fighting d10, Notice d10, Stealth d10 Pace: 10; Parry: 7; Toughness: 3 Special Abilities: · Size ­1: Tumblebleeds are about three
feet in radius when dry. · Thorns: Tumblebleeds drain blood,
causing 2d4 damage every time they hit with a Fighting attack. · Weakness: Dry tumblebleeds are extremely flammable. Add +2 to rolls to see if they catch fire.
Tunnel Critter
Tunnel critters are monstrous subter ranean insects, typically the size of large dogs, with bodies like centipedes. They are armed with large mandibles and

vestigial eyes in front. Each segment has four claw-tipped appendages, which the creature uses for movement, digging, and even limited manipulation of objects.
These creatures are found in deep mines and caverns in the Weird West. They are completely blind, but have a highly developed sense of touch. Mines are generally favored over caverns for the ready supply of food--miners!
Very young tunnel critters are harmless, but after a month or so their shells harden and the poison glands develop. They feed on anything living (even each other) so old, large specimens are very rare. Full-grown specimens can also tunnel through earth.

· Burrowing: Pace 2. Large tunnel critters can burrow through rock. When they burrow up next to a cowpoke, they may attempt a Stealth roll (opposed by the target's Notice) to gain the Drop. Don't forget that multi-action penalty though, Marshal.
· Egg Insertion: On the round after a victim is paralyzed (see below), the critter injects the poor soul with eggs (another bite attack) which hatch within 1d4 hours. If the victim is alive when the eggs hatch, his death is as gruesome as you're guessing. A surgeon can remove the eggs before they hatch with a Healing roll (­2), 15 minutes, and a minor operation.
· Paralytic Poison: Any hero who suffers a wound from the critter's bite must make a Vigor roll (­2) or be paralyzed for 1d4 hours.
· Size +3: These critters are about eight feet long.

Uktena
The uktena is a 30-foot-long snake as thick as a good-sized tree trunk. It has a pair of horns on its head, between which rests a small, brilliant, diamond-like crystal. Its neck has seven faint bands of color, one for each in the spectrum, and its heart rests under the violet stripe.
This beast (also called an unktehi) appears in the mythology of both the northern tribes of the Great Plains and in that of the Southeastern groups. All these native peoples fear its power, but those with arcane abilities occasionally

E nc ou n t e r s
hunt uktena in an effort to secure its unique gemstone.
The crystal (which is about the size of a rifle cartridge) is imbedded in the uktena's skull. It serves as a conduit to the Hunting Grounds, constantly feeding the monster supernatural energies. Not only does this make the creature nearly immune to injury, but it also has a hypnotic effect on any human.
Uktena uses their hypnotic power to render their victims helpless, then force them to slowly approach the creature so it can feed upon them.

· Fear (­1): Anyone who encounters an uktena must make a Guts roll (­1).
· Hypnotism: An uktena can take an action to subvert the will of anyone looking directly at it. This is an opposed Spirit roll. If the uktena wins, the victim is Shaken and approaches the uktena (at half Pace due to being Shaken). Each turn, on its action card, the victim may attempt to break free by initiating another opposed Spirit roll, though the victim suffers a ­2 penalty to such rolls. If the victim wins he is no longer Shaken, and if he scores a raise he may act immediately.
· Invulnerability: Uktena may be Shaken, but they suffer no wounds from magical or mundane attacks.
· Large: Anyone attacking an uktena gains +2 to his attack roll.
· Size +4: An uktena is more than 30' long.

· Weakness (Heart): An uktena's weak spot is its heart. If a cowpoke makes a called shot to this location (­6), the uktena suffers damage normally.
Walkin' Dead
Pulp novels describe your basic walkin' dead as slow and mindless. Obvio usly the writers have never truly encountered them. Creatures like these aren't the kind to shuffle about like they hadn't a thought in their rotting heads.
These suckers are mean and clever. They know people think they're supp osed to be slow and stupid, so sometimes they act that way just to get close. And by the way, they do feed on brains. Delicious, succulent brains. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d4, Strength d6, Vigor d6 Skills: Fighting d6, Intimidation d6, Notice d4, Shooting d6 Pace: 4; Parry: 5; Toughness: 7

· Weakness (Head): Shots to a walkin' dead's head (­4 called shot) do +2 damage, for a total of +6.
Walkin' Fossil
Walkin' fossils come in many varieties. In this case, the fossilized creature is the utahraptor, a quick predator some 20 feet long (including the eight-foot-long tail). Parts of these reanimated beasts may be missing, but its fossilized form grants protection against attacks.
The whole creature appears to be made of stone, like a skeletal statue brought to life. Its empty eye sockets glow with unholy light. The dinosaur has vicious teeth and fore-claws as well as curved hind claws ideal for rending. When on the move, the creature's fossilized bones grind together, making it diffic ult for the creature to catch its prey unawares. Fortunately for the utahraptor, it's a speedy little devil, so folks who take off running at the sound of its approach quickly become fast food.
The walkin' fossil is a smart, dangerous hunter. Utahraptors are pack hunters by nature, but nonetheless very capable alone. It can track prey by smell and wait in ambush if necessary, though it prefers the thrill of the chase. Once it spots prey, the critter usually runs forward and leaps on it with foreclaws and teeth, then rakes with its hind claws. Once a victim is down, the critter turns to other prey, eating only when all available prey is subdued or has vamoosed.

Wall Crawler
Wall crawlers are predators that hang on the shadowy sides of mesas, waiting for unsuspecting travelers to pass below. When they spot prey, they race down from their perches and strike with light ning speed. Their prey almost never sees them coming before it's too late.
Before they strike, wall crawlers are almost totally silent. When fighting, they emit an evil hissing sound that sounds almost like a riled serpent.

Wave Shadow
Wave shadows resemble amphibious, reptilian humanoids. They equip them selves with items taken from their victims, making themselves grim parodies of the people they have killed. Normally, they conceal themselves behind a mystical cloak of darkness, making them appear to be living shadows.
Wave shadows have been rumored to exist in the ocean depths for centuries, and may in fact have existed prior to the Reckoning. A few cryptozoologists theorize that these creatures may be responsible for the myths of mermaids and other fantastic sea creatures.
Regardless of the origins of these elusive monsters, confirmed sightings have become increasingly common over the last sixteen years, usually in the Great Maze.
They are aggressive creatures, living in large clans and preying on small, isolated villages, lone travelers, and occasionally

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
fully-crewed ships. They raid not only for goods, but for food as well, for they consume their victims. Clans of wave shadows set up underwater camps near the isolated communities they plunder. They leave spies hiding in the town, and if anyone arrives to investigate the ghost town, they prepare to attack.

Weeping Widow
This abomination is the grief-stricken spirit of a woman who has witnessed the violent death of at least one member of her immediate family, and then died soon after. These women never had time to mourn their loss, and her grief and rage binds her to the physical world.
A woman possessed by a weeping widow always appears as the widow did when she died. She dresses in funereal clothing, almost always with a veil covering her face. Her face is streaked with tears, and her gloves and handkerchief soaked with them. She speaks and weeps in the voice of her host body in a voice ranging from quiet sobbing to racking wails against fate.
During combat, the possessed woman shrieks howls of rage and pain at the

top of her lungs, cursing the murderers of her sons or husband. If the widow defeats her opponents, she weeps over the bodies of those she has slain--as if they were her lost family--until the victim is dead, at which point the spirit moves on to her next victims.
Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d8, Spirit d12, Strength d4, Vigor d4
Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d12, Notice d4
Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 4
Special Abilities:
· Acid Touch: Str+d10, AP 4. This is a touch attack, allowing the weeping widow a +2 on her Fighting roll.
· Anchor: Weeping widows cannot normally leave the area of their deaths. Since most weeping widows die of grief, this is often their former bedroom or parlor. Only when the widow possesses another can the widow leave this locale, and if her host is killed, she must return to her anchor until she takes another host.
· Possession: The widow is an ethereal being, and remains so unless it possesses a woman who enters the widow's domain by making an opposed Spirit roll. Once possessed, the widow assumes the Agility, Strength, Vigor, and related skills and derived statistics of her host, but retains her own mental abilities.
· Invulnerability: The possessed woman does not suffer Fatigue, and the type of weapon used to kill the widow's loved ones (usually guns) cannot hurt her. If the possessed woman is killed, the widow abandons her and moves on to a new host.
· Tears: Anyone touching or making a successful bare-handed attack (including grappling) against the widow suffers 2d4 damage (AP 4)

from the acidic tears saturating the possessed woman's clothing.
· Weakness (Blessed): A weeping widow suffers a ­2 penalty to any roll to resist powers used by a blessed. The only way to kill a widow permanently is through an exorcism.

Winters can be tough in the north western reaches of America. The cold is so savage, it can drive men and women to resort to the unthinkable to survive: cannibalism. There is a price to be paid for the feast, however, and it's a high one.
Wendigos are the twisted spirits of those who consumed their fellows to survive. Their eerie howls can be heard in just about any cold climate, particularly in the Cascade Mountains. They might also appear in more southern areas during harsh winters, but return north as it grows warmer.
Wendigos crave one simple thing: human flesh to feed their gnawing hunger.

Wereshark
In humanoid form, despite having something of a predatory look about them, weresharks are, for all intents and purposes, normal humans.
In their beastly form, these creatures stand almost seven feet tall and are covered with a rough, gray, scaly hide. Thick webbing stretches between their clawed fingers and toes, and a small dorsal ridge hunches out of their backs. Their eyes become solid black and their lips harden over an abnormally wide mouth filled with a double row of razor sharp teeth. Gills appear on their throats, just below their recessive chins.

These abominations lurk in port cities, particularly in the Maze, and join ship crews. Once the vessel is at sea (or deep within the Great Maze's channels), they prey on the crew. At least one ship plying the waters between Shan Fan and Lost Angels (the Edward Fitzhugh) is crewed entirely by weresharks.

Werewolf
When a full moon shines overhead, humans infected with lycanthropy lose control and change into snarling creatures bent on murder. Some embrace their cursed state and revel in the destruction they cause.
Many werewolves existed even before the Reckoning, their curse passed through blood and bite from a time before the Old Ones closed off the Hunting Grounds.

Will o' the Wisp
This abomination looks like a ball of light about the size of a person's head. Some believe they are apparitions of those killed by quicksand, in mining accidents, or through other misfortunes common to the places where they are found. The truth is unknown, except that they are a terrible hazard.
They are nearly impossible to harm, but are incapable of causing any direct injury themselves. Instead, they tempt others to follow them into the night. They invariably lead victims into danger, then feast on the pain and suffering produced. Wisps are intelligent and able to communicate via flashing patterns of light, even in Morse code. They rarely communicate with humans, however, unless they are trying to manipulate the foolish mortals into making a possibly fatal mistake.

Wolfling
Indian tribes of the Cascade Mountains tell of the wolflings, predatory halfman, half-wolf beasts with pure white coats. These feral creatures live in the lost valleys of the Cascade Range and venture out only to prey upon mankind. The wolflings have honed their pack hunting tactics to a fine, bloody point.
These pack creatures differ from werewolves in that they do not change from human to animal form. They

Humans
Not all the threats the posse faces in the Weird West are the Reckoners' spawn. Here's a selection of the various types of people found throughout the Weird West. As a rule, the statistics presented here are a baseline. Don't be afraid to give a slick-talkin' gunfighter the Persuasion skill, for example.
Unless otherwise stated, Arcane Background (Black Magic) works exactly like Arcane Background (Magic) from the Savage Worlds rulebook. Folks who know black magic have willingly given themselves and their souls to evil in

Grit Wild Card NPCs have Grit equal to half
their number of Edges (rounded down), to a minimum of 1 and maximum of 5.
If an NPC has an Edge, Hindrance, or other ability that directly modifies Grit (like the True Grit Edge, Tenderfoot Hindrance, or being Harrowed), don't count it toward the total number of Edges, and apply any modifiers after you halve the total. That way every cowpoke gets his due, Marshal.

A blessed might be a righteous crusader, a restrained pacifist, or a holy rolling evangelist. Regardless of

Cultist
Dark cults that worship graven idols are the bread and butter of evil in the Weird West. The rank and file cultist is blindly dedicated to his faith, and will happily murder for his dark gods. Further, most maintain public lives as ordinary people, and only practice their blasphemous rituals privately. So unless worshipers are caught in the act of devotion, cults are hard to break up.

Cult Leader
These dark-souled folks are favorites of the Reckoners. They treat with the manitous (whom they believe are dark gods) in exchange for even darker powers, and the Reckoners needn't expend their precious energy creating monsters with these folks around. Often, cult leaders are pillars of the community in their daily life--marshals, mayors, and other notables--and naturally assume their leadership roles.
The most prominent cult in the Weird West is the Cult of Lost Angels. All of Grimme's true believers (except his "inner circle" of 13 elders) use the Cult Leader profile, and more than a few are Wild Cards.

Guardian Angel
The Guardian Angels are the police force of the Church and City of Lost Angels. They are becoming more common away from the city of late, as they accompany proselytizing Church priests on their "crusades." Angels are organized into "flights" of five.

· Bayou Vermilion: Re-Animated. Baron LaCroix "rewards" his most effective troopers with resurrection--of a sort--upon their deaths. They gain the Fear, Fearless, and Undead Monstrous Abilities.
· Black River: Coven. Everyone knows Mina Devlin prefers female employees to males (though being a pragmatist, she'll hire a male gunfighter before a schoolmarm, for example). What most folks don't realize is that she schools her favorites--the few, the proud, the vicious--in true witchcraft. They gain Arcane Background (Black Magic), 10 Power Points, and the bolt, deflection, and fly powers.
· Dixie Rails: Confederate Soldiers. Dixie Rails enjoys the backing of the Confederate government, and can often parlay this into military support. These troops use the Veteran Soldier profile.
· Iron Dragon: Samurai. Though Kang himself is Chinese, he has taken pains to show "face" to the various Asian immigrants throughout the Maze and the West. These warriors are ronin, samurai without a master until Kang offered them a new life in America in exchange for their skills. Samurai have Fighting d10, the Code of Honor Hindrance, and the Sweep Edge. They carry a katana (Str+d10) and wear their traditional armor (+2).
· Union Blue: Union Soldiers. Like Dixie Rails, Union Blue enjoys the

support of its parent government, in this case the Union. These troops use the Veteran Soldier profile.
· Wasatch: X-Squads. Gunmen and other servants who fail in their duties to Hellstromme often wind up in his infamous "X-Squads." These doomed men and women must test the doctor's experimental devices in rigorous field tests. Most X-Squads are equipped with a mix of Gatling weapons, or possibly flamethrowers, and have Shooting d10. A few carry more esoteric devices. They gain a single Weird Science Power with a trapping of your choice, and a d10 in the appropriate skill. All X-Squad troopers gain Repair d6.

Calamity Jane is one of the toughest women in the West, and has even posed as a man to get a job as a teamster or scout. Despite this toughness, Jane has a softer side. She's "collected" groceries for the poor from wealthy "donors," for example.
Jane was an acquaintance of Hickok's while he lived, and she claims they were

more than that. Most folks dismiss this, right alongside her claim that she's spoken with him since his death. She's been hitting the bottle pretty hard since Bill was drygulched, and most believe the only spirits she sees are the alcoholic kind.
Jane's down on her luck at the moment, and gets by on the charity of her friends and the occasional "hostess" job in one of Deadwood's many houses of ill repute.
Jane is a plain looking lady (and we use the term loosely) with brown hair.

Doc Holliday
John Henry Holliday came west back in '72 when he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He hoped the dry weather in Arizona would do his poor lungs some good. Although he dabbles in dentistry (hence the nickname), his business is gambling--and business is good.
Doc's a dangerous man to cross. He has a quick temper, and doesn't hesitate to act when provoked. He's made himself a lot more enemies than friends, but most hold their tongue, else Doc is apt to cut it

out of their heads! That said, he's deeply loyal to those friends he has, including Wyatt Earp, and is an invaluable ally if things should come to gunplay.
Even from these friends, however, Doc keeps his secrets--prime among them his arcane skills. He's an accomplished hexslinger in addition to being an excellent shot!
Doc is dying, and he knows it. He'll go out in a blaze of glory if given half a chance.
Despite his pale complexion (due to consumption), Doc remains a handsome man. He has brown hair and a moustache.

Johnny Ringo
Born John Ringold, Johnny Ringo is the most feared member of the Cowboy gang. He's faster than a rattler, and meaner than a barrel full of `em when he

hits the bottle. Tombstone's streets clear faster than spit sizzles on a griddle when he staggers out of a saloon.
Johnny despises Doc Holliday, and the feeling's mutual. They've nearly traded lead on a few occasions, and everyone guesses the real showdown is coming soon.
Ringo's a good looking hombre, with slicked-back hair and a bushy black moustache.

Raven
Raven is the man responsible for starting up this whole Reckoning mess, and he's pretty happy with the way things are going. That said, he isn't hoping to turn the Weird West into a Deadland overnight. Raven's been around a while--over a century, in fact--and he's a master at planning for the long game.
Raven spends much of his time in the Sioux Nations, a shadowy advisor to Sitting Bull and other chiefs in the area. He no longer directly controls his cult, the Order of the Raven, but its leaders still report to him. At the moment, Raven spends most of his time at the Fountain of Youth in the fabled lost city of Cibola,

the secret location of which he tore out of the last of the Anasazi.
If you absolutely must pit your heroes against him--and you care about maintaining continuity with the Hell on Earth setting--Raven has a number of impersonators around the Weird West who act and speak in his name, all of whom are powerful members of the Order of the Raven.
Raven's stats are presented here, and you can represent his impostors by knocking all the die types down by one, and dropping the Special Abilities and any Background Edges or Edges requiring a Rank of Legendary.
Like Raven, his followers use the black magic equivalent of Arcane Background (Shamanism). This means they don't get their powers directly from nature spirits. Instead Ravenites call upon manitous, and those evil beings force nature spirits to power the shaman's medicine. Nature spirits used in this way are usually corrupted into new manitous or destroyed. Since their powers are (indirectly) provided by nature spirits, Ravenites may only use powers to which shamans normally have access. The impostors have five powers and 25 Power Points.
Raven is a leanly muscled Indian of indeterminate age. His face is lined with shallow wrinkles but his hair remains a lustrous black.

Gear: The bladed war club he wielded against the Old Ones (Str+d12, Parry ­1, AP 4, requires two hands).
Special Abilities:
· Faustian Deal: Raven is the Reckoners' fair-haired boy, and they're not about to let him go gently into that good night. If Raven is ever killed, he automatically returns from the grave Harrowed one week later. Further, once Harrowed he gains the Invulnerability and Weakness listed below.
· Fearless: Raven has seen the worst the Hunting Grounds could throw at him, and never blinked. He is immune to Fear and Intimidation.
· Immortal: Thanks to the power of the Fountain of Youth, Raven no longer ages. He must return to the Fountain once every decade to keep his babyfaced looks, however.
· Invulnerability: Raven can be Shaken, but cannot be wounded by magic or mundane attacks.
· Powers: Raven has every power listed in the Deadlands Player's Guide, and as many Power Points as he needs.
· Weakness (Conquistadors' Weapons): Only the weapons of the very first white men to land on North America can slay Raven. A conquistador's sword, musket, knife, or other weapon causes normal damage.
Red Petals Su
Red Petals Su commands Kang's flagship in the Maze, the Abysmal. Kang's pirates actually fear her more than Kang himself, as she is more liable to lash out at them without provocation. They're also afraid to leave, as she has a reputation

for tracking down and eviscerating deserte rs. She's serious about face!
Su has a love/hate relationship with Kang. Which is to say she hates him, but she can't take him in a fight so she serves him. That said, she's really not enough of a thinker to strike out on her own. She relies on Kang for strategy, and without him to tell her what to do, she'd probably be kicking men's behinds at a two-bit rodeo. As things stand, she's the most feared woman in the Maze.

Reverend Ezekiah Grimme
You can find most of Grimme's bloody backstory earlier in this book, Marshal. What's left? Well, here's where we tell you how your posse can take him out. We'd prefer if you didn't, though. We're kinda fond of the guy, and we want him to go out with a bit more of a bang than we have space to detail here. That said, if you think it's time this devil got his

due, check out his Weakness under his special abilities.
That said, don't forget that if Grimme falls, it'll throw the Near Maze and Lost Angels itself into chaos. When things eventually shake out a few years down the road, it's likely the Church of Lost Angels will remain in control. With any luck, it'll be an actual church by then, with Grimme's influence--and cultists-- eliminated.

Gear: A stout hickory stick (of course it's magic! See Special Abilities, below).
Special Abilities:
· Black Magic: Thanks to his ritual, Grimme's magic appears to be divinely granted, so long as he remains within 75 miles of his church (in other words, always). He has access to every power available to the blessed, and has unlimited Power Points.
· Devil's Deal: Grimme has summoned the powers of Hell to serve him, and

E nc ou n t e r s
may spend an action to summon a demon (see page 90) to his side. He may only summon two such demons at any one time (making him the third part of an unholy trinity). He claims these demons are fallen angels sent by God to gain their redemption through service to Grimme's holy cause. That is, if there are any survivors. · Fearless: Grimme is utterly fearless. He is immune to Fear and Intimidation. · Fire & Brimstone: Grimme may take an action to make a Persuasion roll as he rants and raves on his opponents' sins and Hell-bound souls. All opponents in earshot must successfully oppose Grimme's "sermon" with a Spirit roll or be

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

157

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Shaken by the prospect of eternal damnation.
· Hickory Stick: Grimme's hickory stick is enveloped in pure evil. Any hero it strikes must make a Spirit roll or be struck dead and his soul consumed. There's no coming back Harrowed from that, Marshal. Even if the hero makes the roll, the stick inflicts 2d10 damage.
· Invulnerability: Though Grimme can be Shaken, he suffers no wounds from magical or mundane attacks.
· Majesty: Grimme exudes an aura of righteousness. Any foe must make a Spirit roll (­2) in order to attack him.
· Starvation Spirits: Grimme is surrounded by a passel of starvation spirits at all times. These beings are invisible and incorporeal, but all heroes within 24" of Grimme must make a Vigor roll at the beginning of each round or gain a level of Fatigue due to hunger. A hearty meal removes all Fatigue levels.
· Unholy Charisma: Even though Grimme is a disgusting, depraved old coot possessed by a demon, people rarely see him for what he is. He gains +6 Charisma.
· Weakness (Hickory Stick): Grimme's only weakness is that he isn't truly the Reverend Grimme, who was a kind and decent man. If a hero manages to strike Grimme with the hickory walking stick (Str+d4) the true Reverend Grimme used on his pilgrimage out of the ruins of California, he inflicts damage normally.

Unfortunately, the new Grimme's followers tossed the original Grimme's corpse--along with all his belongings--into Prosperity Bay, and the stick has long since washed out into the Maze.
Seth Bullock
Seth Bullock is Deadwood's town marshal. An easygoing man, he prefers to handle his problems peacefully if possible, but with gunplay if necessary.
Bullock is a man of many parts. In addition to his law enforcement duties, Bullock serves on the Board of Health & Street Commissioners, and owns a number of local businesses. His increasing importance and wealth make him cautious. Bullock's only remarkable feature is a piercing stare, which he relies on to dissuade rowdy cowhands from starting trouble in his town.

Stone
Jasper Stone is so mean Hell wouldn't take him. He found that out when he was shot in the back by his own troops at Gettysburg. Fortunately for him, the Reckoning was just taking hold and he popped right back up Harrowed.
Stone is the first Harrowed of the Reckoning. That's not to say he's the first Harrowed--that dubious distinction lies with someone else (and we ain't sharing yet, partner). But he's the first of this generation--and by far the meanest. Stone is such a bastard, in fact, that Death made him his Servitor, and the Reckoners themselves appointed him their chosen assassin.
When heroes get too powerful (they reach Legendary Rank and are actively hunting down the Reckoners' minions), Stone is sent to take them out. He prefers duels. It's far more amusing for him that way.
When he fires, he always aims for the head. Not for any particular reason--it's just slightly more of a challenge that way, and thus more amusing for him.

Gear: Relic Colt Dragoons (12/24/48, 2d10, RoF 1, Shots unlimited, AP 4).
Special Abilities:
· Aura of Death: Stone is the red right hand of Death. Death may not be fate, but he sure can get her knickers in a bunch. No one, not Stone or anyone else, may use Fate Chips for any purpose while within Stone's line of sight.
· End of the Line: Wounds inflicted by Stone cannot be healed by supernatural means, and Stone's victims cannot return to life by any means (including Harrowed).
· Fear: Stone is obviously Harrowed, and inflicts a Guts check on anyone who gets a good look at his desiccated mug.
· Fearless: Stone's manitou is afraid of him, but Stone himself fears nothing and no one. He is immune to Fear and Intimidation.
· Invulnerability: Though Stone can be Shaken, he takes no wounds from magic and mundane attacks.
· Weakness (Bullets o' Betrayal): Stone can be killed by the actual bullets his own troops used to kill him at Gettysburg. That said, retrieving that old, used-up lead should be a major undertaking. A few rounds might still be lodged in Stone's carcass! The lead must be recast into new bullets before it can be used on Stone, and you can bet the Reckoners will make Stone aware of anyone foolish enough to try such a thing. Finally,

due to his Harrowed state, these bullets can wound Stone but only an Incapacitating head shot puts him down for good.
· Weakness (By His Own Hands): Stone can also be killed by a gun fired by his own stone-cold hands. Best of luck with that one, hombre.
Wild Bill Hickok
Wild Bill came to Deadwood back in '76. He was always a cautious man, but his shoot-first-and-talk-about-it-not-at-all philosophy caught up with him even tually. On August 2, Jack McCall backshot Wild Bill in Nutall & Mann's Saloon No. 10, while Hickok was playing cards.
McCall was captured and tried by a miner's court. The cowardly bush whacker explained that he shot Hickok over a poker debt, and also claimed to be the brother of a man Hickok shot in 1869. The jury acquitted him, despite whispers that McCall was hired by some low-down varmint to murder Hickok to prevent the gunslinger's bid for marshal of Deadwood.
Hickok, however, didn't stay down. He rose from the grave Harrowed, and swore revenge upon McCall and his employer, whoever that might be. He managed to keep his manitou in check for some time as he investigated McCall, but recently lost control.
Hickok was a tall fellow with sharp, handsome features. He's still tall, but his features rotted away just a bit before he awoke as a Harrowed.

Wyatt Earp
Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp has lived a colorful life. He's worked as a teamster, rail worker, buffalo hunter, and stage coach driver. He began his law enforcement career in 1875 as a member of the Wichita police force, and a year later joined his friend Bat Masterson in Dodge as assistant marshal.
Unfortunately for Dodge, Earp is preparing to move on. He and his wife plan to join the other Earp brothers in Tombstone, where Virgil and Morgan both serve as local law. Wyatt himself is about done with wearing a badge, and plans to start his own business. That

E nc ou n t e r s

The Rail Barons
These famous folks are the movers and shakers in the Great Rail Wars. They each have access to vast amounts of wealth and armies of underlings, and most of them constantly hatch various nefarious plans for the posse to foil. While we are providing their statistics here, we recommend you try to avoid letting your heroes bump them off, as they are important to the ongoing Deadlands story.
We'd advise against simply tossing them to the wolves (that'd be your posse, Marshal). Each of these folks is a master planner, and generally stays far from the action. Should the heroes manage to confront one directly, it should only be in the last act of a campaign. Even then, if there is a way for one of these hombres to make a miraculous escape, to cheat death, or in some way evade your heroes' clutches, these individuals have the resources, smarts, and muscle to pull it off!
Baron Simone LaCroix
Baron LaCroix is a well-built black man of 40 years, his piercing gray eyes overshadowed by a menacing brow. He routinely shaves his scalp, and his face is free of beard or moustache. A small gold earring loops around his right earlobe.
You can find out more about LaCroix on page 163.

Special Abilities:
· Chual: As a powerful voodooist, LaCroix can chual for the loa. In this case, however, LaCroix serves as chual to the Reckoners themselves! This link means he only suffers a ­1 penalty to Faith rolls per power Rank, and he can also assume a limited portion of the Reckoners' power (too much would destroy him from the inside out). He may only chual for each Reckoner once per week. LaCroix makes a Faith roll as a normal action, and if successful he gains one of the following abilities (his choice) for one hour or until a Joker is dealt, whichever comes first.
· Death: LaCroix makes an unarmed melee attack. If successful, his target must make a Spirit roll (opposed by LaCroix's Spirit) or die.
· Famine: Any damage inflicted by LaCroix (or any weapon he wields), instead of causing wounds, causes levels of Fatigue as if the target suffered from starvation. These "wounds" may be soaked as normal, but the victim must roll Spirit to soak rather than Vigor.
· Pestilence: LaCroix may expel a cloud of noxious, plague-ridden breath. Place a Large Burst Template adjacent to LaCroix. Anyone within must make a Vigor roll (opposed by LaCroix's Vigor) or die. Unless the roll is made with a raise, the victim

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

gains the Ailin' (Major) Hindrance, permanently.
· War: LaCroix's Strength, Vigor, Fighting, and Knowledge (Battle) are increased to d12+2. This increases his Parry to 9.
· Invulnerability: LaCroix is a favored servant of the Reckoners. Though he can be Shaken, he cannot be wounded by magical or mundane means.
· Misogyny: Thanks to his history with his mother and sister, LaCroix hates all women unconditionally. He inflicts +2 damage on any woman he attacks, but any woman who strikes LaCroix gains the same bonus.
· Weakness (Ritual Dagger): LaCroix can only be harmed by the ritual dagger he used to murder his sister (the very same ritual dagger he carries today).
Doctor Darius Hellstromme
Hellstromme's story can be found on page 71. Unbeknownst even to himself, Hellstromme is the prime Servitor of Pestilence on Earth, thanks to his part in the proliferation of ghost rock and the technological advances he's pioneered. This has led to countless outbreaks of ghost rock fever, for which the good doctor is indirectly responsible.
Darius Hellstromme is a culturedlooking gent, with a neatly trimmed beard and moustache and a "distinguishing" scar on the right side of his face.

Gear: Tool kit, monocle.
Special Abilities:
· Contingency: Hellstromme is always in the company of at least one of his automatons, which is under orders to return his body to one of his private labs should he perish. There, an automated process implants Hellstromme's brain into an automaton frame, returning him to life.
· Mad Insight: If madness is a job requirement for inventors (and most folks think it is, these days), Hellstromme's overqualified. His gizmos count as infernal devices, and never malfunction or run out of Power Points so long as he wields them. Further, given an hour in his lab, he can invent (and build!) a new such device to reflect any Power he wishes. Finally, he receives +4 on Smarts, Knowledge, and Weird Science rolls.

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

· Touched: Hellstromme's insanity is a special sort. Given a calm situation and a Persuasion roll (opposed by the target's Spirit), he can convince anyone of anything that he himself believes. He's not delusional, so he won't talk someone into trying to fly to the moon to get a piece of moon cheese, but he could easily convince a hero that murdering his friends is not only justified, but necessary. Heroes forced to commit suicide or perform some heinous act may make another Spirit roll (opposed by Hellstromme's Persuasion) to break Hellstromme's hold.
Fitzhugh Lee
Fitzhugh Lee is a stocky man running toward overweight in his middle age. His rounded features are accented by a bushy moustache and goatee. Despite his advancing girth, he still cuts quite an imposing figure when decked out in his dress grays.
Lee's history is discussed on page 68.

E nc ou n t e r s
Special Abilities: · Guardian Devil: Lee is
watched over by a manitou he believes is the ghost of his uncle, General Robert E. Lee. He can beg his "uncle" for protection in combat, which is equivalent to using the deflection power, but he rolls Persuasion instead of Spellcasting. Lee has 10 Power Points for this Power.
Joshua Chamberlain

Kang
Kang is a tall, burly Asian man in his late 30s. He sports a long moustache, but is otherwise cleanly shaven. Scars from epic kung fu duels criss-cross his features, and his close-cropped hair grows irregularly across his heavily scarred scalp.

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

165

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Kang is driven by the dream of a new nation out West, with him at the top of the heap. He takes a cut from almost every major criminal enterprise west of the Rockies and his influence is spreading all the time.
His traditional method of dealing with trouble is to try to buy it off. If there's one thing he hates, it's an incorruptible do-gooder prying into his affairs. When the subtle approach fails, he has plenty of muscle to ensure all problems get resolved.
Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d8, Spirit d8, Strength d12, Vigor d12
Skills: Boating d10, Fighting d12, Gambling d8, Guts d12, Healing d6, Intimidation d12, Investigation d6, Notice d12, Persuasion d10, Spellcasting d12, Stealth d12, Taunt d10

Powers (Spellcasting): Bolt, dispel, detect/conceal arcane, fear, obscure; Power Points: 25
Gear: Imperial robes.
Special Abilities:
· Black Magic: Kang serves nefarious powers in order to gain the Arcane Background (Black Magic), but unbeknownst to the warlord he is touched by the Reckoners themselves. Through their influence Kang may access multiple Arcane Backgrounds, and imparts the same ability to those he instructs in the dark arts.
Mina Devlin
Mina's bloody history is discussed on page 66, though it is important to note that for all her evil, Mina Devlin is unique among the sorcerous Rail Barons in that

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

166

she is not in service of the Reckoners (not directly, anyway). She considers it a point of pride that she's accomplished her myriad achievements under her own steam, without striking a pact with outside forces (beyond that which is required for her witchcraft), and pride is one of her few weak spots.
Ms. Devlin is a ravishing, raven-haired beauty with alabaster skin, full red lips, and sensuous green eyes. She's not afraid to use her appearance to her advantage, and generally dresses to impress. Nonetheless, she tucks a derringer into her garter belt, and somehow manages to conceal her trademark whip on her person at all times.
As murderously ruthless as she is devastatingly attractive, Mina does whatever it takes to advance her agenda, and woe betide any who cross her.

E nc ou n t e r s
Powers: Beast friend, blast, bolt, boost/ lower trait, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, fear, fly, obscure, shape change, speak language, stun, teleport; Power Points: 30. Gear: Derringer (5/10/20, 2d6, RoF 1, Shots 2, AP 1), whip (Str+d4, Parry ­1, Reach +2. If Mina Devlin scores a raise on her attack roll, the attack does not inflict an additional d6 damage. Instead, her unfortunate victim suffers a ­2 to his Parry until his next action).
Mundane Animals
There are countless mundane creatures in the Weird West, many of which you'll find in the Savage Worlds rules. Here are four more dangerous critters, all native to our land, that your posse might stumble across in the wilds.
Buffalo (Bison) Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d12+2, Vigor d12 Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d6 Pace: 7; Parry: 5; Toughness: 10 Special Abilities: · Horns: Str+d6. · Gore: Buffalo use the charge
maneuver to gore their opponents with their long horns. If they can move at least 6" before attacking, they add +4 to their damage total. · Size +2: Buffalo are large creatures. · Stampede: The real danger from a big herd of buffalo lies in a stampede. Any unfortunates caught in a stampeding herd are trampled by their hooves. These bystanders must make an Agility roll (­2) each round or suffer 2d6+2 damage. After three successful Agility rolls, the individual has got out of the way of the herd.

John Rogers (Order #49932984)

Deadlands Marshal's Handbook
Coyote Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d8 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d6, Vigor d6 Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d6, Notice d10, Stealth d8 Pace: 10; Parry: 5; Toughness: 4 Special Abilities: · Bite: Str+d4. · Fleet-Footed: Coyotes roll a d10 when
running instead of a d6. · Quick: Coyotes discard Action Cards
of 5 or lower and draw another. · Size ­1: Coyotes are relatively small
creatures.
Grizzly Bear Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d12+4, Vigor d12+2 Skills: Fighting d8, Guts d10, Intimidation d10, Notice d8, Swim d6 Pace: 8; Parry: 6; Toughness: 11 Special Abilities: · Bear Hug: Bears don't actually "hug"
their victims, but they do attempt to use their weight to pin their prey and rend it with their claws and teeth. A bear that hits with a raise has pinned his foe. The opponent may only attempt to escape the "hug" on his action, which requires a raise on an opposed Strength roll.

· Mama Bear!: A grizzly defending her cubs is a force of nature. Her Parry is reduced by 2 but she adds +2 to all Fighting and Strength rolls, and her Toughness. She ignores all wound penalties.
· Claws: Str+d6.
· Size +2: These creatures can stand up to eight feet tall and weigh over 1,000 pounds.
Scorpion Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d4, Strength d4, Vigor d4
Skills: Fighting d6, Stealth d8, Taunt d4
Pace: 4; Parry: 5; Toughness: 2
Special Abilities:
· Poison (­2): Anyone wounded or even Shaken by a sting must make a Vigor roll or immediately become Incapacitated (death follows in 1d4 hours). A successful roll means the affected location is paralyzed for 1d6 days.
· Size ­2: Scorpions are tiny creatures.
· Small: Foes subtract 2 from attack rolls against a scorpion, due to its small size.
· Sting: Str+Poison.
